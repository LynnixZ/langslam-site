It's not explicitly stated in the current view description, but it's common for goals to be persistent unless interacted with.\n",

At that time, (4,6) was directly in front of me (my position is (3,6), facing East means x increases). (4,6) was listed as a wall. The rule states \"You cannot toggle the wall,\" which creates a contradiction. The most plausible interpretation is that certain \"walls\" are actually doors that can be toggled open.\n",
      "3.  **Current View Walls:** The current view shows walls at (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) (among others). This implies the entire row where I am is walls, including my position (3,6), which is impossible. A more reasonable interpretation is that all cells in this row *except* my current position (3,6) are walls.\n",
      "4.  **Goal as a Wall:** The current wall list also states that (0,5), (1,5), ..., (6,5) are walls. This means (4,5), where the goal was previously located, is currently listed as a wall. If the goal is a wall, I cannot reach it.

      "2.  **Move `forward` twice:** This should shift the goal from (5,2) to (4,2), then to (3,2). At (3,2), the goal is aligned with my X-coordinate.\n",
      "3.  **Turn `left`:** From facing West, turn left to face South. (This turn would rotate the X-axis back to the previous X+1 direction). Alternatively, turn `left` twice to face North.\n",

The fact that the move apparently succeeded, but then the *new* view (after moving) shows the square (3,5) (which would now be my former position relative to the new view, or simply the square directly in front of me *in the new setup*) as a wall, strongly suggests a misinterpretation of the \"walls at coordinates\" description or a bug in the game environment's feedback.\n",
