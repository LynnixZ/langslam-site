2025-07-04 11:55:32,813 [INFO] - You are a logical robot agent with a top-down view of your entire grid world. Your task is to create a plan to solve a mission.
In this world, all objects are represented by 2 coordinates.
The first coordinate is the row (x-axis). The postive direction is east/right, and the negative direction is west/left.
The second coordinate is the column (y-axis). The positive direction is south/down, and the negative direction is north/up.

### Mission
"open the red door then the blue door"

### Recent Action History (up to 10 steps)
This is the first step.

### Current World State
Your current position is (9, 3) and you are facing down (South).
Here is a list of all noteworthy objects on the map:
- There are grey walls at absolute coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 7), (8, 0), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 7), (10, 0), (10, 7), (11, 0), (11, 2), (11, 3), (11, 4), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 7), (12, 0), (12, 7), (13, 0), (13, 7), (14, 0), (14, 7), (15, 0), (15, 1), (15, 2), (15, 3), (15, 4), (15, 5), (15, 6), (15, 7).
- A red door is at absolute coordinate (4, 6), and it is closed.
- A blue door is at absolute coordinate (11, 1), and it is closed.

### Your Actions
Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).

2025-07-04 11:56:47,673 [INFO] - You are a logical robot agent with a top-down view of your entire grid world. Your task is to create a plan to solve a mission.
In this world, all objects are represented by 2 coordinates.
The first coordinate is the row (x-axis). The postive direction is east/right, and the negative direction is west/left.
The second coordinate is the column (y-axis). The positive direction is south/down, and the negative direction is north/up.

### Mission
"open the red door then the blue door"

### Recent Action History (up to 10 steps)
- Step 1: Chose action sequence ['left']. Your current position is (9, 3) and you are facing right (East).
- Step 2: Chose action sequence ['right']. Your current position is (9, 3) and you are facing down (South).
- Step 3: Chose action sequence ['right']. Your current position is (9, 3) and you are facing left (West).
- Step 4: Chose action sequence ['left']. Your current position is (9, 3) and you are facing down (South).

### Current World State
Your current position is (9, 3) and you are facing down (South).
Here is a list of all noteworthy objects on the map:
- There are grey walls at absolute coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 7), (8, 0), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 7), (10, 0), (10, 7), (11, 0), (11, 2), (11, 3), (11, 4), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 7), (12, 0), (12, 7), (13, 0), (13, 7), (14, 0), (14, 7), (15, 0), (15, 1), (15, 2), (15, 3), (15, 4), (15, 5), (15, 6), (15, 7).
- A red door is at absolute coordinate (4, 6), and it is closed.
- A blue door is at absolute coordinate (11, 1), and it is closed.

### Your Actions
Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).
Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example: 
[forward]

2025-07-04 12:00:53,682 [INFO] - The red door is at (4, 6). I am at (10, 4) facing South.
2025-07-04 12:00:53,682 [INFO] - To open the red door, I need to reach (4, 6) and be facing it. Given the door is at (4,6) and walls are at (4,0) through (4,5) and (4,7), it's likely a horizontal door. This means I'd need to approach from (3,6) facing East or (5,6) facing West. Let's assume I can toggle it by being at (4,6) and facing into it. Or, more commonly, standing one step away from it.
2025-07-04 12:00:53,682 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 12:00:53,682 [INFO] - Let's assume for a horizontal door at (X, Y) within a wall at row X, I need to be at (X-1, Y) facing East or (X+1, Y) facing West.

- A red door is at absolute coordinate (4, 6), and it is closed.
- A blue door is at absolute coordinate (11, 1), and it is closed.

### Your Actions
Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).
Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example: 
[forward]
