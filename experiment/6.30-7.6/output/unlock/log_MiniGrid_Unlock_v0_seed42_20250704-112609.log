2025-07-04 11:26:09,934 [INFO] - You are a logical robot agent with a top-down view of your entire grid world. Your task is to create a plan to solve a mission.
In this world, all objects are represented by 2 coordinates.
The first coordinate is the row (x-axis). The postive direction is east/right, and the negative direction is west/left.
The second coordinate is the column (y-axis). The positive direction is south/down, and the negative direction is north/up.

### Mission
"open the door"

### Recent Action History (up to 10 steps)
This is the first step.

### Current World State
Your current position is (4, 4) and you are facing left (West).
Here is a list of all noteworthy objects on the map:
- There are grey walls at absolute coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 5), (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 5).
- A red key is at absolute coordinate (3, 2).
- A red door is at absolute coordinate (5, 1), and it is locked.

### Your Actions
Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).
Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example:

### Your Actions
Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
