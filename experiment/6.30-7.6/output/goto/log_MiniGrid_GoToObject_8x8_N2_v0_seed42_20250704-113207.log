2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - **Current State Analysis:**
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - 1.  **Your current position:** (5, 2)
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - 2.  **Your current facing direction:** Down (South)
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - 3.  **Red key location:** (5, 3)
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - **Reasoning:**
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - The goal is to reach the red key at (5, 3).
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - You are currently at (5, 2) and facing South.
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - In this coordinate system, moving South increases the column (y-coordinate) by 1 while keeping the row (x-coordinate) the same.
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - Therefore, moving 'forward' from (5, 2) while facing South will take you to (5, 3), which is the location of the red key.
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:33:10,369 [INFO] - Although the recent action history shows multiple 'forward' attempts while remaining at (5, 2), the "Current World State" clearly states your current position and the key's position. As a logical agent, the most direct and logical action based on the current state and the world's movement rules is to move forward to the target location. Assuming no unstated permanent obstacles, this action should accomplish the mission.

2025-07-04 11:33:45,160 [INFO] - Upon reviewing the "Current World State", I observe that there is no "red key" listed among the noteworthy objects. The only listed objects are grey walls defining the perimeter of an 8x8 grid, and a yellow ball at (5, 6).
2025-07-04 11:33:45,160 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:33:45,160 [INFO] - Since the red key is not currently visible, I cannot directly go to it. The logical course of action is to explore the environment to find it.
2025-07-04 11:33:45,160 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:33:45,160 [INFO] - Looking at the "Recent Action History", it shows that from Step 4 to Step 12, I repeatedly chose 'forward' (9 times), but my position remained (5, 2) and I continued to face South. This strongly suggests that moving South from (5, 2) is currently blocked or ineffective. Therefore, continuing to attempt 'forward' in the South direction would likely be unproductive.
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - Given that I cannot move South, I must change my orientation to explore other parts of the grid.
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - From (5, 2) facing South:
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - - Turning 'right' would make me face West, allowing me to explore (5,1) and then hit a wall at (5,0).
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - - Turning 'left' would make me face East, allowing me to explore (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), and (5,6) (where the yellow ball is) before hitting a wall at (5,7).
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - - Turning 'left' twice (or 'right' twice) would make me face North, allowing me to explore (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) before hitting a wall at (0,2).
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - To begin a systematic exploration, it is reasonable to start by sweeping along one of the cardinal directions that isn't currently blocked. Turning left (East) allows me to explore a relatively long path (cells (5,3) to (5,6)) and potentially encounter the yellow ball, which could be a clue or just a landmark. This path is productive for searching.
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:33:45,161 [INFO] - Therefore, the first step is to change direction.

2025-07-04 11:34:02,669 [INFO] - Moving 'forward' would take me to (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), and eventually (5,6), where the yellow ball is located.
2025-07-04 11:34:02,669 [INFO] - This path allows me to explore new cells and also approach a known object (the yellow ball), which might be relevant to the mission or provide more information.
2025-07-04 11:34:02,669 [INFO] - The recent action history indicates that moving South from (5,2) was previously blocked (as multiple 'forward' commands while facing South kept the agent at (5,2)). Therefore, moving East is a sensible alternative direction for exploration.

2025-07-04 11:34:33,052 [INFO] - The list of noteworthy objects does not include a "red key". This means its location is unknown to me, and I must search for it.
2025-07-04 11:34:33,053 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:34:33,053 [INFO] - The recent action history shows that in Step 16, I chose 'forward', but my position remained (6, 2). This indicates that moving forward (East) from my current position might be blocked, even though no obstacle is explicitly listed at (6,3) and it's not a wall.
2025-07-04 11:34:33,053 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:34:33,053 [INFO] - If 'forward' is blocked, a logical next step in exploration is to change my facing direction and attempt to move.
2025-07-04 11:34:33,053 [INFO] - 1.  **Turn 'left'**: This would make me face North (up). From (6,2) facing North, I could attempt to move to (5,2). (5,2) is a valid, unblocked coordinate within the map boundaries.
2025-07-04 11:34:33,053 [INFO] - 2.  **Turn 'right'**: This would make me face South (down). From (6,2) facing South, moving forward would take me to (7,2). However, (7,2) is a wall, so this path would immediately be blocked.
2025-07-04 11:34:33,053 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:34:33,053 [INFO] - Therefore, turning 'left' is the most logical action to allow for further exploration, as it opens up a new valid direction of movement.

2025-07-04 11:35:06,169 [INFO] - - Facing North (negative y-direction): Moving `forward` would take me to (6,1). This is within the traversable area (1,1) to (6,6).
2025-07-04 11:35:06,169 [INFO] - - Turning `right` (to face East / positive x-direction): Moving `forward` would take me to (7,2). The list of walls confirms there is a wall at (7,2), so this move would be blocked, as observed in Step 16 of the recent history.
2025-07-04 11:35:06,169 [INFO] - - Turning `left` (to face West / negative x-direction): Moving `forward` would take me to (5,2). This cell has been visited recently (Steps 14 and 15 were from (5,2) to (6,2)).
2025-07-04 11:35:06,170 [INFO] - - Turning `right` twice (to face South / positive y-direction): Moving `forward` would take me to (6,3). This is within the traversable area (1,1) to (6,6).
2025-07-04 11:35:06,170 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:35:06,170 [INFO] - Since the red key's location is unknown, the strategy must be to systematically explore the accessible area. Both moving North to (6,1) or South to (6,3) from my current position would lead to an unvisited cell, initiating exploration.
2025-07-04 11:35:06,170 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:35:06,170 [INFO] - Given that I am already facing North, the most direct next action to begin systematic exploration (e.g., a sweep pattern along the northern edge of the map) is to move forward. This will bring me to (6,1), placing me at the northernmost point of my current column, from where I can then turn and sweep along that edge.

2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - The mission is "go to the red key".
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - According to the "Current World State", "Here is a list of all noteworthy objects on the map:", and the red key is *not* listed. This implies the red key is not currently present as a noteworthy object on the map.
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - There are two main interpretations for this scenario:
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - 1.  **The mission is impossible**: If the red key is truly not on the map, it's impossible to "go to" it.
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - 2.  **The red key was picked up**: The recent action history includes a `pickup` action at Step 13. If the red key was picked up at that point (e.g., at (5,3) if the agent was at (5,2) facing South), then it is now in the agent's possession. If the agent possesses the red key, it is arguably "at" the red key's location (itself), meaning the mission is already complete.
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - In either case (impossible mission or mission complete), the agent needs to select a valid action from the given list. Since there is no "mission complete" or "report impossibility" action, the most logical choice is to take an action that causes minimal disruption or signifies a stalled state.
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:35:44,527 [INFO] - Current position: (6, 1)
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - Facing: up (North)
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - Walls: (6,0) is a wall.
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - If the agent attempts to move `forward` from (6,1) while facing North, it will try to move to (6,0), which is a wall. This action will result in the agent staying at (6,1) and continuing to face North. This effectively serves as a "no-op" in terms of movement.
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - This 'no-op' action is appropriate because:
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - *   If the mission is impossible (no key on map), it avoids making arbitrary movements towards a non-existent goal.
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - *   If the mission is complete (key in inventory), it avoids unnecessary movement when no new objective is provided.
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:35:44,528 [INFO] - Therefore, the most logical next action is to attempt to move forward, which will result in remaining in place due to the wall.

2025-07-04 11:36:18,421 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:36:18,421 [INFO] - To determine the location of the red key, I refer to the "Recent Action History".
2025-07-04 11:36:18,422 [INFO] - At Step 13, I chose action sequence ['pickup'] at position (5, 2) while facing down (South). When facing South at (5,2), the object directly in front of me would be at (5,3). This suggests that the red key might have been at (5,3) and the previous pickup attempt failed for some reason, or it was left behind. Given the mission, it's the most logical assumption that the red key is at (5,3).

2025-07-04 11:36:52,006 [INFO] -     *   If I move `forward`, I would move towards (7,1), which is a wall. This action would likely result in no movement.

2025-07-04 11:36:52,006 [INFO] -     *   If I turn `right`, I would face South. From (6,1) facing South, moving `forward` would take me to (6,2), which is an open space. This is a valid move into the explorable area.
2025-07-04 11:36:52,006 [INFO] -     *   If I turn `right` twice, I would face West. From (6,1) facing West, moving `forward` would take me to (5,1), which is an open space. This is also a valid move into the explorable area.

2025-07-04 11:36:52,007 [INFO] - 5.  **Choose the best next action for exploration:** Since moving `forward` or turning `left` and moving `forward` both lead to immediate walls, the only way to move into the open space is to turn `right`. This allows me to then move `forward` to either (6,2) (by turning once right) or (5,1) (by turning twice right). The first step towards either of these exploration paths is to turn `right`.
2025-07-04 11:36:52,007 [INFO] -

2025-07-04 11:37:30,945 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:37:30,945 [INFO] - The problem states there are grey walls forming an enclosed 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7).
2025-07-04 11:37:30,945 [INFO] - - Walls are at (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for y from 0 to 7 and x from 0 to 7.
2025-07-04 11:37:30,945 [INFO] - - This means the navigable area is effectively from (1,1) to (6,6).
2025-07-04 11:37:30,946 [INFO] - 
2025-07-04 11:37:30,946 [INFO] - There is no red key listed in the "Current World State". This means the red key is not currently visible or present in the current observable grid.
