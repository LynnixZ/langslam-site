2025-07-04 14:25:27,365 [INFO] - --- Agent's Turn (Overall Move #1) ---
2025-07-04 14:25:27,365 [INFO] - ==================================================
2025-07-04 14:25:27,365 [INFO] - You are a logical robot agent with a top-down view of your entire grid world. Your task is to create a plan to solve a mission.
In this world, all objects are represented by 2 coordinates.
The first coordinate is the row (x-axis). The postive direction is east/right, and the negative direction is west/left.
The second coordinate is the column (y-axis). The positive direction is south/down, and the negative direction is north/up.

### Mission
"put the green ball near the green box"

### Rules
Lava is deadly, and you cannot step on it. if you do, you will lose the game.
You can not toggle or cross the wall, it is a solid object.
You can only interact with objects that are directly in front of you.
    
### Recent Action History (up to 10 steps)
This is the first step.

### Current World State
Your current position is (5, 3) and you are facing right (East).
Here is a list of all noteworthy objects on the map:
- There are grey walls at absolute coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7).
- A green ball is at absolute coordinate (2, 3).
- A purple ball is at absolute coordinate (2, 6).
- A green box is at absolute coordinate (6, 6).

### Your Actions
Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).
Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example: 
[forward]

If you are certain about what to do, you can select a sequence of actions, for example,
[forward, right, forward, forward, pickup, right]
But you don't have to rush. Remember turning or moving will give you a new view and new information!
