          <h3>Prompt</h3>
          <div class="prompt-box"><pre>You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - &#x27;forward&#x27;: Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - &#x27;left&#x27;: Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - &#x27;right&#x27;:  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
5.  Boxes are movable objects. If a box is directly in front of you, you can &#x27;pickup&#x27; it. &#x27;drop&#x27; places the carried box on your current cell.



### YOUR TASK ###

    You will also see flags in your view. Your have to return those flags as well, but your main tasks is still find the empty spaces. Each flag is uniquely colored. Note that you can use flags to help you with localization.


All coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).
If you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.
Your starting absolute position is (4, 3). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in &quot;&amp;&amp;&amp;&quot; delimiters. For example:
&amp;&amp;&amp;
empty spaces at coordinates: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).
