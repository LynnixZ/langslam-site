You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (3, 4). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.
Note that each flag is uniquely colored. 




        ### WARNING: DATA CORRUPTION ###
        Your primary challenge is that the data acquisition process is unreliable. You must account for the following potential anomalies:
        - **Log Discontinuity:** A continuous block of actions may be entirely missing. You will see two consecutive steps in the log (e.g., Step 40 followed by Step 41), but the robot's pose will have changed drastically and inexplicably between them, as if it teleported.

        You cannot blindly trust every entry in the log. You must use the full sequence of observations to infer the most likely map and trajectory.
        Note: There are 3 flags in the room, and the room is 10x10 (including walls) in size.
        
### OBSERVATION LOG ###
Initial Observation: You're facing East. You can see a blue flag at coordinate (0, -2), a grey flag at coordinate (4, -1).
Step1: right.  You see nothing of interest..
Step2: left.  You can see a blue flag at coordinate (0, -2), a grey flag at coordinate (4, -1).
Step3: forward.  You can see a grey flag at coordinate (3, -1).
Step4: forward.  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (4, -2), (4, -1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), a grey flag at coordinate (2, -1).
Step5: forward.  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (4, -2), (3, -2), (4, -1), (3, -1), (4, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), a grey flag at coordinate (1, -1).
Step6: forward.  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (4, -2), (3, -2), (2, -2), (4, -1), (3, -1), (2, -1), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), a grey flag at coordinate (0, -1).
Step7: right.  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (4, -2), (3, -2), (2, -2), (1, -2), (0, -2), a purple flag at coordinate (4, 1).
Step8: right.  You can see a grey flag at coordinate (0, 1), a blue flag at coordinate (4, 2)

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).
&&&
