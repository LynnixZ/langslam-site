You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:

My reasoning process is as follows:

I will track my absolute position (x, y) and direction (North, South, East, West) at each step. My initial state is position (1, 1) and direction East. For each observation, I will convert the local (Depth, Side) coordinates of any seen objects into absolute (x, y) coordinates to build the map.

**Direction-to-Coordinate Mapping:**
*   **Facing East:** Absolute (x, y) = (My_x + Depth, My_y + Side)
*   **Facing West:** Absolute (x, y) = (My_x - Depth, My_y - Side)
*   **Facing North:** Absolute (x, y) = (My_x - Side, My_y - Depth)
*   **Facing South:** Absolute (x, y) = (My_x + Side, My_y + Depth)

**Step-by-step trace:**

*   **Initial State:** Position: (1, 1), Direction: East.
    *   Observation: red flag at local (4, 0).
    *   Calculation: (1 + 4, 1 + 0) = (5, 1).
    *   Map: A red flag is at (5, 1).
*   **Step 1:** Action: `forward`.
    *   New Position: (2, 1), Direction: East.
    *   Observation: red flag at local (3, 0).
    *   Calculation: (2 + 3, 1 + 0) = (5, 1). This confirms the red flag's position.
*   **Step 2:** Action: `right`.
    *   Position: (2, 1), New Direction: South. No objects seen.
*   **Step 3:** Action: `right`.
    *   Position: (2, 1), New Direction: West. No objects seen.
*   **Step 4:** Action: `right`.
    *   Position: (2, 1), New Direction: North. No objects seen.
*   **Step 5:** Action: `right`.
    *   Position: (2, 1), New Direction: East. The red flag at local (3, 0) is seen again, confirming its position at (5, 1).
*   **Step 6:** Action: `left`.
    *   Position: (2, 1), New Direction: North. No objects seen.
*   **Step 7:** Action: `left`.
    *   Position: (2, 1), New Direction: West. No objects seen.
*   **Step 8:** Action: `left`.
    *   Position: (2, 1), New Direction: South. No objects seen.
*   **Step 9:** Action: `forward`.
    *   New Position: (2, 2), Direction: South. No objects seen.
*   **Step 10:** Action: `forward`.
    *   New Position: (2, 3), Direction: South.
    *   Observation: grey flag at local (4, 1).
    *   Calculation: (2 + 1, 3 + 4) = (3, 7).
    *   Map: A grey flag is at (3, 7).
*   **Step 11:** Action: `forward`.
    *   New Position: (2, 4), Direction: South.
    *   Observation: grey flag at local (3, 1).
    *   Calculation: (2 + 1, 4 + 3) = (3, 7). This confirms the grey flag's position.
*   **Step 12:** Action: `forward`.
    *   New Position: (2, 5), Direction: South.
    *   Observation: grey flag at local (2, 1).
    *   Calculation: (2 + 1, 5 + 2) = (3, 7). This confirms the grey flag's position.
*   **Step 13:** Action: `forward`.
    *   New Position: (2, 6), Direction: South.
    *   Observation: grey flag at local (1, 1).
    *   Calculation: (2 + 1, 6 + 1) = (3, 7). This confirms the grey flag's position.
*   **Step 14:** Action: `left`.
    *   Position: (2, 6), New Direction: East. No objects seen.
*   **Step 15:** Action: `forward`.
    *   New Position: (3, 6), Direction: East.
    *   Observation: yellow flag at local (4, -1).
    *   Calculation: (3 + 4, 6 + -1) = (7, 5).
    *   Map: A yellow flag is at (7, 5).

Here is a step-by-step reconstruction of the map based on the observation log.

**Initial State**
*   **Absolute Position**: (1, 1)
*   **Absolute Direction**: East (vector: (1, 0))
*   **Map**: Empty

**Initial Observation**
*   You are at (1, 1) facing East.
*   You see a green flag at local coordinate (Depth=3, Side=2).
*   To convert this to absolute coordinates:
    *   Forward movement (Depth) is in the East direction (+1 to the first coordinate).
    *   Sideways movement (Side) is 90 degrees to the right of forward (South, +1 to the second coordinate).
    *   Absolute position = (current_x + depth, current_y + side) = (1 + 3, 1 + 2) = (4, 3).
*   **Map Update**: A green flag is added at (4, 3).

**Step 1**
*   **Action**: `forward`.
*   You move one step in your current direction (East).
*   **New Position**: (1, 1) + (1, 0) = (2, 1).
*   **Direction**: East.
*   **Observation**: You see a green flag at local (2, 2).
*   **Verification**: The flag's absolute position is (current_x + depth, current_y + side) = (2 + 2, 1 + 2) = (4, 3). This matches the previous observation.
*   **Map**: {green flag at (4, 3)}.

**Step 2**
*   **Action**: `left`.
*   You turn 90 degrees left on the spot.
*   **Position**: (2, 1).
*   **New Direction**: North (vector: (0, -1)).
*   **Observation**: You see a wall at local (1, 0), which is directly in front of you.

**Step 3**
*   **Action**: `forward`.
*   Your previous observation showed a wall directly in front of you at local (1, 0). Your movement is blocked.
*   **Position**: (2, 1) (no change).
*   **Direction**: North.

**Step 4**
*   **Action**: `left`.
*   **Position**: (2, 1).
*   **New Direction**: West (vector: (-1, 0)).

**Step 5**
*   **Action**: `right`.
*   **Position**: (2, 1).
*   **New Direction**: North (vector: (0, -1)).
*   **Observation**: You again see a wall at local (1, 0).

**Step 6**
*   **Action**: `left`.
*   **Position**: (2, 1).
*   **New Direction**: West (vector: (-1, 0)).
*   **Observation**: Your view does not show a wall at local (1, 0). The path is clear.

**Step 7**
*   **Action**: `forward`.
*   You move one step in your current direction (West).
*   **New Position**: (2, 1) + (-1, 0) = (1, 1).
*   **Direction**: West.

**Step 8**
*   **Action**: `right`.
*   **Position**: (1, 1).
*   **New Direction**: North (vector: (0, -1)).
*   **Observation**: You see a wall at local (1, 0).

**Step 9**
*   **Action**: `forward`.
*   Movement is blocked by the wall seen in the previous step.
*   **Position**: (1, 1) (no change).
*   **Direction**: North.

**Step 10**
*   **Action**: `forward`.
*   Movement is still blocked by the wall.
*   **Position**: (1, 1) (no change).
*   **Direction**: North.

**Step 11**
*   **Action**: `left`.
*   **Position**: (1, 1).
*   **New Direction**: West (vector: (-1, 0)).
*   **Observation**: You see a wall at local (1, 0).

**Step 12**
*   **Action**: `forward`.
*   Movement is blocked by the wall seen in the previous step.
*   **Position**: (1, 1) (no change).
*   **Direction**: West.

**Step 13**
*   **Action**: `left`.
*   **Position**: (1, 1).
*   **New Direction**: South (vector: (0, 1)).
*   **Observation**: Your view does not show a wall at local (1, 0). The path is clear.

**Step 14**
*   **Action**: `forward`.
*   You move one step in your current direction (South).
*   **New Position**: (1, 1) + (0, 1) = (1, 2).
*   **Direction**: South.

**Step 15**
*   **Action**: `right`.
*   **Position**: (1, 2).
*   **New Direction**: West (vector: (-1, 0)).

**Final Map Summary**
Throughout the entire process, only one non-wall object was observed. Its position was calculated and confirmed to be (4, 3).

&&&
a green flag at coordinate (4, 3).

2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).
&&&
