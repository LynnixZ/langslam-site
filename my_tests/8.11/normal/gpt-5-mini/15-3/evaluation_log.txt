2025-08-12 14:38:53,310 - INFO - Prompt for episode #0:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (2, 7). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Initial: position (2,7), facing West. I will track (x,y), orientation, and map flags I observe (converting local (depth,side) -> global coordinates).

Conversion reference (forward, right) per orientation:
- East: forward=(+1,0), right=(0,+1) => global = (x + d, y + s)
- North: forward=(0,-1), right=(+1,0) => global = (x + s, y - d)
- West: forward=(-1,0), right=(0,-1) => global = (x - d, y - s)
- South: forward=(0,+1), right=(-1,0) => global = (x - s, y + d)

I'll step through the log, tracking absolute position (x,y) with start (12,12) and orientation North. Forward vectors: North=(0,-1), East=(1,0), South=(0,1), West=(-1,0). Right vectors: North=(1,0), East=(0,1), South=(-1,0), West=(0,-1). Global coordinate = position + depth*forward + side*right.

Key steps where flags were seen (I show agent pos and facing after the action, the local flag coordinate, and the computed global coordinate):

- Start: pos (12,12), facing North.
- Step9 (after moving): pos (10,9), facing North. saw green at local (4,-1) -> global (10,9) + (0,-4) + (-1,0) = (9,5).
- Step10: pos (10,8), North. saw green at (3,-1) -> (10,8) + (0,-3) + (-1,0) = (9,5). (same green)
- Step23: pos (5,6), North. saw purple at (4,-1) -> (5,6) + (0,-4) + (-1,0) = (4,2).
- Step24: pos (5,5), North. saw purple at (3,-1) -> (5,5) + (0,-3) + (-1,0) = (4,2). (same purple)
- Step25..32 and many later sightings: many green observations map to (9,5) (confirmed from different positions/orientations).
- Step27,28: purple sightings at local coords (3,-2) and (2,-2) from pos (6,5) and (6,4) (facing North) both map to (4,2).
- Step56: pos after forward (6,11), facing West. saw purple at (4,-1) -> (6,11) + (-4,0) + (0,1) = (2,12).
- Step57: pos (5,11), West. saw purple at (3,-1) -> (5,11) + (-3,0) + (0,1) = (2,12). (same purple)
- Step63,67-70 and others: repeated purple sightings map to (4,2).
- Step78-82 and many others: repeated green sightings map to (9,5).

No other distinct flag coordinates appear. Thus the consistent map contains:
&&&
a green flag at coordinate (9,5) a purple flag at coordinate (4,2) a purple flag at coordinate (2,12).

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (12, 2). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

I'll simulate the agent step-by-step (position as (x,y), East = +x, South = +y). Start: position (12,2), facing East.

Movement/orientation rules used:
- forward: move 1 in facing direction (no forward was blocked in the log).
- left/right rotate 90° on the spot.
- local -> absolute mapping: abs = pos + depth*F + side*R, where F is the forward unit vector for the current facing and R is the right unit vector (right = 90° clockwise relative to forward in this coordinate system).

Key vector values by facing:
- East: F=(1,0), R=(0,1)
- South: F=(0,1), R=(-1,0)
- West: F=(-1,0), R=(0,-1)
- North: F=(0,-1), R=(1,0)

Now the steps that reported flags (I show the local coordinate -> absolute coordinate calculation):

- Steps 20–24: while facing West and moving from (9,5) -> (5,5):
  - Observations of yellow at local (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2) map to absolute (5,3).
    Example: at pos (9,5), facing West (F=(-1,0), R=(0,-1)): (9,5)+4*F+2*R = (5,3).
  - So a yellow flag is at (5,3).

- Steps 24,28–31: while facing West/South around pos (5,5) -> (3,7):
  - Observations of green at local coords (4,-2), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (0,2) map to absolute (1,7).
    Example: at pos (5,7), facing West: (5,7)+4*(-1,0)+0*(0,-1) = (1,7).
  - So a green flag is at (1,7).

- Steps 37–38 and repeated later: while turning to North then East etc.:
  - The same green at local coords (4,-2), (3,-2) observed from different orientations also maps to (1,7) (consistent).

- Steps 44–50: while facing North then East then North, repeated yellow sightings at local coords (4,1),(3,1),(2,1),(1,-2),(0,-2),(2,0),(1,0) all map to (5,3).
  - Confirms the yellow flag at (5,3).

- Steps 65,69–71: while around positions (7,9)->(9,11) facing South:
  - Observations of a grey flag at local (4,-1),(4,1),(3,1),(2,1) map to absolute (8,13).
    Example: at pos (7,9), facing South (F=(0,1),R=(-1,0)): (7,9)+4*(0,1)+(-1)*R = (8,13).
  - So a grey flag is at (8,13).

No other flagged objects were reported in the log. The various wall observations were ignored for mapping (they only affect movement if directly in front; none prevented forward movement in the log).

Final map:
&&&
a yellow flag at coordinate (5,3) a green flag at coordinate (1,7) a grey flag at coordinate (8,13).

2025-08-12 14:45:01,454 - INFO - Prompt for episode #4:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (5, 9). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Step-by-step reasoning (positions are absolute (x,y), x increases east, y increases south):

- Start at (5,9) facing West. Initial observation: green at local (3,0). Facing West: forward = (-1,0), right = (0,-1). So green at (5,9)+3*(-1,0) = (2,9).
- Step1 turn right -> facing North. Steps2-3 forward -> (5,8)->(5,7).
- Step4 right -> facing East. Steps5-6 forward -> (6,7)->(7,7).
- Step7 left -> facing North. Steps8-9 forward -> (7,6)->(7,5).
- Step10 forward -> (7,4). Step11 forward -> (7,3).
- Step12 right -> East. Step13 right -> South.
- Steps14-15 forward -> (7,4)->(7,5).
- Step16 left -> East. Step17 forward -> (8,5). Observed green at local (4,0) → (8,5)+4*(1,0) = (12,5).
- Step18 right -> South. Step19 forward -> (8,6).
- Step20 left -> East. Observation green at (4,-1) local → (8,6)+4*(1,0)+(-1)*(0,1) = (12,5).
- Step21 forward -> (9,6). Observation green at (3,-1) → (12,5).
- Step22 forward -> (10,6). Observation green at (2,-1) → (12,5).
- Steps23-26 moves lead to (10,9). Step27 right -> West. Steps28-29 forward -> (9,9)->(8,9).
- Step30 left -> South. Steps31-32 forward -> (8,10)->(8,11).
- Step33 right -> West. Steps34-36 forward -> (7,11)->(6,11)->(5,11). Observations at these steps (green at various local positions) all map to (2,9).
- Step37 forward -> (4,11) observation green → (2,9). Step38 forward -> (3,11) observation green → (2,9).
- Step39 right -> North. Observation green at (2,-1) local → (2,9).
- Steps40-44 moves to (4,9) with several observations; green observations map to (2,9).
- Steps45-47 forward -> (4,6). Step48 forward -> (4,5) observation red at local (4,-2) → (4,5)+4*(0,-1)+(-2)*(1,0) = (2,1).
- Steps49-54 forward moves to (4,1) with red sightings at different local coords; they all map to (2,1).
- Step55 right -> East. Steps56-62 forward moves to (11,1). No new flags.
- Step63 right -> South. Observed green at (4,-1) → (11,1)+4*(0,1)+(-1)*(-1,0) = (12,5).
- Steps64-69 forward to (12,4) with green sightings; they map to (12,5). Step70 forward -> (12,5) (arrived near that green).
- Steps71-74 forward to (12,9). Step75 right -> West. Step76 forward -> (11,9).
- Step77 right -> North. Observations map to (12,5).
- Steps78-82 moves and observations map to (12,5).
- Steps83-92 moves westward ending at (1,7); observations during these mostly map to (2,9).

Summary of unique mapped flags:
- Green flags consistently observed at absolute coordinates (2,9) and (12,5).
- Red flags consistently observed at absolute coordinate (2,1).

Final map:
&&&
a green flag at coordinate (2,9) a green flag at coordinate (12,5) a red flag at coordinate (2,1).

2025-08-12 14:46:26,836 - INFO - Prompt for episode #5:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (2, 3). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Reasoning (summary of motion and mappings):
- Start at absolute (2,3) facing East. Local coordinates (depth, side) convert to absolute depending on facing:
  - East: (x+depth, y+side)
  - South: (x-side, y+depth)
  - West: (x-depth, y-side)
  - North: (x+side, y-depth)
- I followed the log, updating absolute position on each successful "forward" (blocked forwards would show a wall at local (1,0) in that observation; none of the flagged observations indicated a blocked move), and updated facing on each turn.
- Every flag sighting, converted from the reported local (depth, side) to absolute coordinates using the robot's absolute position and facing at that time.
- All observed instances correspond to three persistent world flags (seen repeatedly from different viewpoints):
  - A grey flag repeatedly seen at absolute coordinate (3, 1).
  - A green flag repeatedly seen at absolute coordinate (5, 11).
  - A blue flag repeatedly seen at absolute coordinate (2, 12).

Final map summary:
&&&
a grey flag at coordinate (3,1) a green flag at coordinate (5,11) a blue flag at coordinate (2,12).

2025-08-12 14:48:25,960 - INFO - Prompt for episode #6:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (11, 10). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Reasoning (tracking absolute position and facing; East=+x, South=+y; start at (11,10), facing South):

Conversion used: absolute = current_pos + d*fdir + s*rdir, where fdir is forward vector for current facing and rdir is the right vector (rdir = (-f_y, f_x)). I only list steps where flags were observed (moves between those steps are noted when they change current_pos).

- Start: pos=(11,10), facing=South (fdir=(0,1), rdir=(-1,0)). No flags.
- Step1 right -> facing West. (no flags)
- Steps2–7: moved West to pos=(7,10) through forwards; many observations of a red flag at various local coords (e.g., step2 local (4,2), step3 (3,2), step6 (2,2), step7 (1,2)). Using fdir=(-1,0), rdir=(0,-1) these all map to absolute (6,8). So red at (6,8).
- Steps8–11: turned and moved, continued to see that same red flag from different local coords (all compute to (6,8)). By Step12 forward arrived at pos=(6,8) (on top of that red flag).
- Steps13–22: various turns and moves (no new flags).
- Step23 (pos=(7,5), facing South): observed red at local (3,1) -> absolute (6,8).
- Step24 (moved to (7,6), facing South): red at (2,1) -> (6,8).
- Step25 left -> facing East. Step26 forward to pos=(8,6): observed a green at local (4,1) -> absolute (12,7).
- Step27 (pos=(9,6)): observed yellow at local (4,-1) -> absolute (13,5), and green at (3,1) -> (12,7).
- Step28 (pos=(10,6)): yellow local (3,-1) -> (13,5); green local (2,1) -> (12,7).
- Step29 (pos=(11,6)): yellow local (2,-1) -> (13,5); green local (1,1) -> (12,7).
- Step30 left -> facing North (pos=(11,6)): yellow local (1,2) -> (13,5).
- Step31 left -> facing West. (no new flags)
- Step32 forward to pos=(10,6) observed red local (4,-2) -> (6,8).
- Steps33–36 moved South to pos=(10,9); observations of green local (1,-2) and (0,-2) mapped to (12,7).
- Steps37–44 moved/turned around (walls seen; ignored). Many subsequent moves follow; later visits repeatedly observe the same three absolute flag positions:
  - Red observations repeatedly map to absolute (6,8) (many steps: e.g., 38–42, 75–79).
  - Green observations repeatedly map to absolute (12,7) (many steps: e.g., 26,27,28,29,33,34,92–96,97–103).
  - Yellow observations repeatedly map to absolute (13,5) (e.g., 27,28,29,30,97,98).
- Final steps (100–103): after moving to pos=(13,8) and turning to face West, final observation (step103) green at local (1,1) maps to absolute (12,7).

Summary of unique flagged absolute coordinates found (walls ignored):
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (6,8) a green flag at coordinate (12,7) a yellow flag at coordinate (13,5).

Reasoning (step-by-step, tracking absolute position and facing; East = +x, South = +y):

- Start: at (6,7), facing North.

I will only list positions & facings for steps where orientation or movement changes are relevant and where observations report flags (walls ignored except to note they don't block movement unless at depth 1). Movements between noted steps are applied sequentially.

- Step1: right → facing East (pos (6,7)).
- Step2: forward → move to (7,7).
- Step3: forward → (8,7).
- Step4: left → facing North.
- Step5: forward → (8,6).
- Step6: forward → (8,5).
- Step7: forward → (8,4). (saw walls at depth 4)
- Step8: forward → (8,3). (saw walls at depth 3 & 4)
- Step9: right → facing East.
- Step10: right → facing South.
- Step11: forward → (8,4).
- Step12: forward → (8,5).
- Step13: left → facing East.
- Step14: forward → (9,5).
- Step15: forward → (10,5). (saw walls at depth 4)
- Step16: right → facing South.
- Step17: forward → (10,6).
- Step18: forward → (10,7).
- Step19: left → facing East. (saw walls at depth 4)
- Step20: forward → (11,7). (saw walls at depth 3 & 4)
- Step21: right → facing South, pos (11,7). Observation: green at local (4,-2) and purple at local (3,-2).
  - Facing South: forward F=(0,1), right R=(-1,0).
  - Map local->abs: (d,s) -> pos + d*F + s*R.
  - Green at (4,-2) → offset (0,4) + (2,0) = (2,4) → absolute (11+2, 7+4) = (13,11).
  - Purple at (3,-2) → offset (0,3) + (2,0) = (2,3) → absolute (13,10).
- Step22: forward → move to (11,8). Observation: green at (3,-2), purple at (2,-2).
  - Green (3,-2) → abs (11,8)+((0,3)+(2,0)) = (13,11) (same green).
  - Purple (2,-2) → abs (11,8)+((0,2)+(2,0)) = (13,10) (same purple).
- Step23: forward → move to (11,9). Observation: green at (2,-2), purple at (1,-2).
  - Green (2,-2) → abs (11,9)+((0,2)+(2,0)) = (13,11).
  - Purple (1,-2) → abs (11,9)+((0,1)+(2,0)) = (13,10).
  (Consistent: green at (13,11), purple at (13,10).)
- Step24: right → facing West.
- Steps25–29: five forwards West → positions: (10,9),(9,9),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9).
- Step30: left → facing South at pos (6,9). Observation: grey flag at local (4,1).
  - Facing South F=(0,1), R=(-1,0).
  - Grey at (4,1) → offset (0,4) + (-1,0) = (-1,4) → absolute (6-1, 9+4) = (5,13).
- Steps31–36: turns/moves lead to pos (6,4) facing North then forward to (6,3) etc (no new flags).
- Steps37–38: moved to (6,3) with wall sightings (no flags).
- Step39: left → facing West.
- Step40: forward → (5,3).
- Step41: left → facing South.
- Step42: forward → (5,4).
- Step43: right → facing West.
- Step44: forward → (4,4). (saw walls)
- Step45: left → facing South.
- Steps46–50: forwards South to (4,9) then step50 forward to (4,9) → after step50 pos (4,9). Observation at step50: grey flag at local (4,-1).
  - Facing South F=(0,1), R=(-1,0).
  - Grey at (4,-1) → offset (0,4) + (1,0) = (1,4) → absolute (4+1, 9+4) = (5,13). (Same grey flag.)
- Step51: right → facing West (walls seen).
- Step52: forward → (3,9) (walls).
- Step53: left → facing South at (3,9). Observation: grey flag at local (4,-2).
  - Grey (4,-2) → offset (0,4) + (2,0) = (2,4) → absolute (3+2, 9+4) = (5,13). (Same grey.)
- Steps54–80: further moves and turns (no new distinct flags). Final position ends at (-5,13) facing West after step80 (walls observed).

Final deduced flag positions (unique):
- green flag at (13,11)
- purple flag at (13,10)
- grey flag at (5,13)

&&&
a green flag at coordinate (13,11) a purple flag at coordinate (13,10) a grey flag at coordinate (5,13).

2025-08-12 14:50:59,736 - INFO - Prompt for episode #8:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (8, 7). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Step-by-step reasoning (positions are absolute (x,y); start at (8,7) facing South; East = +x, South = +y):

- Start: (8,7), facing South. Initial view empty.
- After Step2 (forward): moved to (7,7), facing West.
- After Step4: (7,8), facing South.
- After Step5: (7,9), facing South.
- After Step7: (6,9), facing West.
- After Step9: (6,10), facing South — saw only walls (no flags).
- After Step10: (6,11), facing South — walls only.
- Steps 11–20: moved and turned; ended at (5,7), facing West, no flags seen.
- Step21: moved to (4,7), facing West — walls only.
- Steps 22–24: moved to (4,5), facing North.
- Step25 (right -> now facing East) at (4,5): saw a grey flag at relative (4,-2).
  - Facing East: absolute = (x + d, y + s) = (4+4, 5-2) = (8,3). Record grey flag at (8,3).
- Steps 26–34: moved around; by Step35 at (10,7) facing East saw walls.
- Step36 (left -> now facing North) at (10,7): saw grey flag at relative (4,-2).
  - Facing North: absolute = (x + s, y - d) = (10-2, 7-4) = (8,3). Same grey flag (confirming).
- Steps 37–39: moved to (11,8), facing South.
- Step40 (forward to 11,8 facing South): saw yellow at (4,-2) and blue at (4,0).
  - Facing South: absolute = (x - s, y + d).
    - Yellow (4,-2): (11 - (-2), 8 + 4) = (13,12).
    - Blue (4,0): (11 - 0, 8 + 4) = (11,12).
- Step41 (forward to 11,9 facing South): saw same yellow/blue at relative depth 3 — they map to same absolutes (13,12) and (11,12).
- Steps 42–55: moved north to (9,3) facing North; multiple observations of a grey flag at various relative coords (including (1,-1),(0,-1), etc). Each maps to (8,3). These repeatedly confirm the grey flag at (8,3).
- Steps 56–63: rotations and moves brought the agent to positions that again observed the same grey flag (various relative coords like (0,1),(1,0),(0,2)), all mapping to (8,3).
- Step59 moved onto (8,3) (agent's absolute position became (8,3) at that moment); subsequent observations continued to point to the same location for the grey marker.
- Remaining steps show only walls or repeat the same grey flag observations. No other distinct flagged locations were observed.

No forward move was blocked by a wall (whenever a forward action occurred, the previous observation did not show a wall at relative (1,0)), so all forward moves above succeeded.

Final map summary:
&&&
a grey flag at coordinate (8,3) a yellow flag at coordinate (13,12) a blue flag at coordinate (11,12).

3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (6, 6). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).

Reasoning (step-by-step, showing position, facing, and mapped flag observations). I ignore walls for the map (they only affect whether a forward move is blocked; none of the logged forwards that reported flags were blocked):

Start: absolute pos (6,6), facing North. No flags seen.

1) Step1 left -> facing West, pos (6,6). Saw yellow at local (3,1).
   Mapping (West): forward = (-1,0), right = (0,-1).
   Absolute = (6,6) + 3*(-1,0) + 1*(0,-1) = (3,5) → yellow at (3,5).

2) Step2 forward -> moved to (5,6). Saw yellow at local (2,1).
   Absolute = (5,6)+2*(-1,0)+1*(0,-1) = (3,5) → same yellow (3,5).

3) Step3 forward -> moved to (4,6). Saw yellow at local (1,1) → (3,5) again.

4) Step4 left -> facing South, pos (4,6). Saw grey at local (4,0).
   (South): forward=(0,1), right=(-1,0).
   Absolute = (4,6)+4*(0,1)+0 = (4,10) → grey at (4,10).

5) Step5 forward -> moved to (4,7). Saw grey at local (3,0) → (4,10) again.

6) Step6 forward -> (4,8). Saw grey local (2,0) → (4,10).

7) Step7 forward -> (4,9). Saw grey local (1,0) → (4,10).

8) Step8 left -> facing East, pos (4,9). Saw grey local (0,1).
   (East): forward=(1,0), right=(0,1).
   Absolute = (4,9)+0+1*(0,1) = (4,10) → same grey (4,10).

9–12) Moved around; Step11 (facing South at (6,9)) saw grey at (1,2) → maps to (4,10). Step12 (at (6,10)) saw grey at (0,2) → (4,10). All consistent with single grey at (4,10).

13–18) Various turns/moves (no new flag positions).

19) Step19 forward (facing East at (8,8)) saw red at local (4,1).
   (East): forward=(1,0), right=(0,1).
   Absolute = (8,8)+4*(1,0)+1*(0,1) = (12,9) → red at (12,9).

20–37) Movements and turns repeatedly observed red at local positions that map to (12,9) (Steps 34–38 also report red at local coords mapping to (12,9)). All consistent with a single red at (12,9).

38) Step38 right (facing South at (11,9)) saw red at local (0,-1) → (12,9) consistent.

39–49) Moves, then at Step42 (facing West at (8,9)) saw grey at local (4,-1) → (4,10) consistent.

50–56) Moving West along a line produced a sequence of yellow observations at locals (4,-1),(3,-1),(2,-1),(1,-1),(0,-1) etc. All map to absolute (3,5). Step56 explicitly saw yellow at local (0,-1) → (3,5).

57–66) Moving south and east then north; steps 57–65 observed walls and greys that consistently map to (4,10). Step64 grey local (2,1) → (4,10). Step65 grey local (1,1) → (4,10).

66–69) Facing North at (3,9) observed yellow at local (4,0),(3,0),(2,0) and then (0,-2) while turning to East — all map to (3,5).

70–79) Moves, Step74 saw red at local (4,2) while facing East at (8,7) → (12,9) again.

80–89) Further moves and wall observations; no new flag positions.

Conclusions: all flag observations collapse to three distinct absolute coordinates:
- Yellow flags always map to (3,5).
- Grey flags always map to (4,10).
- Red flags always map to (12,9).

Final map summary:
&&&
a yellow flag at coordinate (3,5) a grey flag at coordinate (4,10) a red flag at coordinate (12,9).
