You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (8, 11). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (12, 10). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Reasoning (positions are absolute (x,y); start at (12,10), facing West; East = +x, South = +y):

- Start: pos (12,10), facing West. Initial obs: nothing.
- Step1 right -> facing North, pos (12,10). (no flags)
- Steps2-3 forward -> pos (12,8), facing North. (no flags)
- Step4 left -> facing West, pos (12,8).
- Step5 forward -> pos (11,8). Saw green at local (4,0). Facing West: forward = (-1,0), right = (0,-1). Global = (11,8) + 4*(-1,0) = (7,8). Record: green @ (7,8).
- Step6 forward -> pos (10,8). Saw green at local (3,0) -> (7,8) (confirm).
- Step7 forward -> pos (9,8). Saw red at (4,-1) -> global = (9,8) + 4*(-1,0) + (-1)*(0,-1) = (5,9). Record: red @ (5,9). Also saw green at (2,0)->(7,8).
- Step8 forward -> pos (8,8). Saw red at (3,-1)->(5,9), green at (1,0)->(7,8).
- Step9 right -> facing North, pos (8,8). Saw green at (0,-1)->(7,8).
- (Many intermediate moves with repeated confirmations of the same two flags.)
- Step16 first yellow seen: after movements pos (10,5) facing North. Saw yellow at local (4,-1). Map: (10,5)+ (0,-4) + (-1)*(1,0) = (9,1). Record: yellow @ (9,1).
- Steps17-20 etc. repeatedly confirm yellow at (9,1).
- Step25 onward many forwards/turns repeatedly confirm green (7,8) and red (5,9).
- Step30 (pos (6,8), facing West) saw a yellow at local (3,2) -> global (3,6). Record: yellow @ (3,6).
- Steps31-33 confirm yellow at (3,6) and green/red at (7,8)/(5,9).
- Step40 first blue seen: pos (7,11), facing East, saw blue at local (4,2) -> global (7,11) + (4,2) = (11,13). Record: blue @ (11,13).
- Steps43–45 confirm blue at (11,13).
- From here onward the log repeatedly confirms the same set of flag locations from different viewpoints:
  - green at (7,8)
  - red at (5,9)
  - yellow at (3,6)
  - yellow at (9,1)
  - blue at (11,13)
- Final steps (up to Step123) continue to observe/redetect those same coordinates; Step123 reports a red that maps to (5,9), consistent.

Final map summary:
&&&
a green flag at coordinate (7,8) a red flag at coordinate (5,9) a yellow flag at coordinate (3,6) a yellow flag at coordinate (9,1) a blue flag at coordinate (11,13)

2025-08-12 16:15:16,811 - INFO - Prompt for episode #2:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (2, 13). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).

Reasoning (summary of movements and how observations map to absolute coordinates):

- Start at absolute (2,13), facing South.
- I applied each turn/forward in order and tracked absolute position and facing. I used these direction vectors:
  - East: forward=(+1,0), right=(0,+1)
  - South: forward=(0,+1), right=(-1,0)
  - West: forward=(-1,0), right=(0,-1)
  - North: forward=(0,-1), right=(+1,0)
  For a local observation (depth d, side s) the absolute offset = d*forward + s*right; absolute = current_pos + offset.
- I ignored grey walls for the final map, but used presence/absence of a wall at local (1,0) when deciding if a forward move was blocked. None of the listed forward attempts that would have been blocked (local (1,0) wall) prevented moves in a way that changes the final flagged locations.

Key mapped observations (representative steps showing mapping; many observations were repeat sightings confirming same locations):

1. Red cluster at absolute (2,10):
   - First seen Step4 at local (3,-2) while at (4,13) facing North -> maps to (2,10).
   - Confirmed repeatedly (Steps 5,15,18,19,23,24,27-29,33..etc). All those local coords map to (2,10).

2. Red cluster at absolute (10,13):
   - First seen Step8 at local (4,1) from absolute (6,12) facing East -> maps to (10,13).
   - Confirmed repeatedly (Steps 11-13,80-85,105,109-114, etc). All those local coords map to (10,13).

3. Red cluster at absolute (9,6):
   - First clear mapping Step37: at pos (11,9) facing North local (3,-2) -> maps to (9,6).
   - Confirmed repeatedly (Steps 40-46,69-75,102-103, etc).

4. Green cluster at absolute (12,9):
   - First seen Step33-36 while moving eastward; e.g. Step33 at pos (8,9) facing East local (4,0) -> maps to (12,9).
   - Confirmed many times later (Steps 87-101,102-105, etc).

5. Yellow cluster at absolute (9,4):
   - First clear mapping Step41: at pos (10,8) facing North local (4,-1) -> maps to (9,4).
   - Confirmed repeatedly (Steps 42-46,69, etc).

No other distinct flag coordinates were found; other flag observations are repeats that map to one of the above three red positions or the single green and yellow positions.

Final map summary:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (2,10) a red flag at coordinate (9,6) a red flag at coordinate (10,13) a green flag at coordinate (12,9) a yellow flag at coordinate (9,4).

2025-08-12 16:17:12,052 - INFO - Prompt for episode #3:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (13, 3). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

I'll track orientation and absolute position (x,y). Start at (13,3) facing East. Mapping rules I used:
- Facing East: absolute = (x + d, y + s)
- Facing South: absolute = (x - s, y + d)
- Facing West: absolute = (x - d, y - s)
- Facing North: absolute = (x + s, y - d)

I step through the log, updating (x,y) on successful forwards (no forward was blocked when the prior observation contained no wall at local (1,0)). I record flags (color, local (d,s)) as absolute coordinates using the mapping appropriate for the current facing and position.

Key observations and mappings (only flag sightings summarized):

- Early while moving west from (13,5) → (9,6) (facing West), repeated sightings of green at local (4,-1)/(3,-1)/(2,-1)/(1,-1)/(0,-1) and yellow at local offsets all map to:
  - green at (9,7)
  - yellow at (10,7)

- Separate cluster seen (first noted step12) while facing South around position (9,6) and nearby moves produced repeated sightings mapping to:
  - green at (10,10)

- Purple cluster first seen when facing West around (3,7) and later while circling maps to:
  - purple at (1,5)

- Another purple cluster seen while moving south from (9,9)/(9,10)/(11,10) maps to:
  - purple at (9,13)

I verified sightings of the same local coordinates under different orientations and positions consistently mapped to the same absolute coordinates above.

Final unified map:
&&&
a green flag at coordinate (9,7) a green flag at coordinate (10,10) a yellow flag at coordinate (10,7) a purple flag at coordinate (1,5) a purple flag at coordinate (9,13)

2025-08-12 16:18:54,085 - INFO - Prompt for episode #4:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (5, 7). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.
