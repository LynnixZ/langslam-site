2025-08-12 15:08:18,381 - INFO - Prompt for episode #0:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 10). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Reasoning (step-by-step, summary):
- Start: position (1,10), facing North. Forward when facing North: y - 1; East: x + 1; South: y + 1; West: x - 1. Local-to-absolute conversions used per orientation.
- I followed the 129 commands, updating absolute position and orientation after each command. I ignored wall observations for mapping content (but used them implicitly to check consistency when needed).
- All color observations map consistently to a small set of absolute coordinates:
  - Repeated yellow observations at various local depths/sides always map to absolute (12,9). (Observed early around Steps 20–35, 73, 78–79, etc.)
  - A cluster of grey-flag observations (local coordinates like (4,2),(3,2),(2,2),(2,-2),...) all map to absolute (13,4).
  - Repeated blue-flag observations (local coords along the forward line) map to absolute (9,3).
  - A cluster of purple-flag observations (local coords like (3,-2),(2,-2),(1,-2),(0,-2),(1,0),(2,0),...) all map to absolute (8,11).
  - A group of yellow observations in the southward part of the route map to (3,13).
  - One observation (Step112) of a yellow at local (0,2) while facing West maps to (3,11) — a separate yellow flag there.
- All mapped flag locations are internally consistent across the log (same absolute coordinates seen from different robot poses and orientations).

Final map summary:
&&&
a yellow flag at coordinate (12,9) a grey flag at coordinate (13,4) a blue flag at coordinate (9,3) a purple flag at coordinate (8,11) a yellow flag at coordinate (3,13) a yellow flag at coordinate (3,11)

2025-08-12 15:10:29,481 - INFO - Prompt for episode #1:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (8, 8). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).

I'll step through the log, track position and orientation, convert each reported local (Depth, Side) sighting to absolute coordinates, and collect unique flag locations.

Coordinate mapping rule I used:
- At any time absolute_position + d*forward_vector + s*right_vector = absolute coordinates of local (d,s).
- Forward/right vectors by facing:
  - East: forward = (+1,0), right = (0,+1)
  - West: forward = (-1,0), right = (0,-1)
  - South: forward = (0,+1), right = (-1,0)
  - North: forward = (0,-1), right = (+1,0)

Start: absolute position (8,8), facing West. I updated position and facing after each move and applied the mapping to every reported flag. Key sightings (showing the mapping result):

- Steps 13–18, 53, 56–58, 83–87, 90–96, 91–93, etc. consistently mapped many local purple sightings to absolute (3,12). Example: at step13 pos (4,8) facing South, local (4,1) -> (4,8) + (0,4) + (-1,0) = (3,12).
  => purple flag at (3,12)

- Steps 31–34 mapped purple local positions to absolute (11,3) and blue to (11,2). Example: step31 pos (8,3) facing East, purple local (3,0) -> (8,3)+(3,0)=(11,3); blue local (3,-1) -> (8,3)+(3,-1)=(11,2).
  => purple flag at (11,3)
  => blue flag at (11,2)

- Steps 22, 35–40, 107–111 and others mapped many local purples to absolute (12,8). Example: step22 pos (8,10) facing East, local (4,-2) -> (8,10)+(4,-2)=(12,8).
  => purple flag at (12,8)

- Steps 23–26, 34–39, 43, 106–109 repeatedly mapped yellow local positions to absolute (10,7). Example: step23 pos (8,10) facing North, local (3,2) -> (8,10)+(2,-3) = (10,7).
  => yellow flag at (10,7)

No other distinct flag coordinates were introduced by the log.

Final map summary:
&&&
a purple flag at coordinate (3,12) a purple flag at coordinate (11,3) a purple flag at coordinate (12,8) a yellow flag at coordinate (10,7) a blue flag at coordinate (11,2).

2025-08-12 15:12:13,230 - INFO - Prompt for episode #2:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (2, 10). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

- Step1 forward -> moved to (2,9). (Only walls seen.)
- Step2 right -> facing East at (2,9). Saw a purple at local (0,2) -> maps to (2,11).
  - Record: purple (2,11).
- Step3 forward -> (3,9). nothing.
- Step4 forward -> (4,9). saw red at local (4,2) -> maps to (8,11).
  - Record: red (8,11).
- Step5 left -> facing North. Steps6-8 move forward to (4,6). nothing.
- Step9 right -> facing East at (4,6). saw blue at (4,-2) -> maps to (8,4).
  - Record: blue (8,4).
- Step10 forward -> (5,6). saw blue at (3,-2) -> maps to (8,4) (same).
- Steps11-20 include turns/moves; repeated blue sightings (local coords) consistently map to (8,4).
- Step21-31 various moves to (11,10) with wall-only sightings.
- Step32 right -> facing West at (11,10). saw red at (3,-1) -> maps to (8,11) (matches earlier).
- Step33 forward -> (10,10). red at (2,-1) -> (8,11).
- Step34 left -> facing South at (10,10). red at (1,2) -> (8,11).
- Step35 forward -> (10,11). red at (0,2) -> (8,11).
  - Confirms red at (8,11) repeatedly.
- Step36 right -> facing West at (10,11). saw a grey flag at (4,-2) -> maps to (6,13).
  - Record: grey (6,13). Also saw red at (2,0) -> (8,11).
- Steps37-39 forward (to (8,11) then (7,11)), repeated grey sightings at local coords mapping to (6,13).
- Step40 forward -> (6,11). saw grey at (0,-2) -> (6,13), and purple at (4,0) -> (2,11) (matches earlier purple).
- Step41 forward -> (5,11). saw red at (4,0) -> maps to (1,11), and purple at (3,0) -> (2,11).
  - Record: red (1,11). (This is a separate red flag distinct from the red at (8,11).)
- Step42 forward -> (4,11). saw red at (3,0) -> (1,11), purple at (2,0) -> (2,11).
  - Confirms red (1,11) and purple (2,11).
- Step43 right -> facing East at (4,11). purple at (0,-2) -> (2,11).
- Steps44-46: from (4,11) facing East saw red at (4,0) -> (8,11) (again) and grey at (2,2) -> (6,13). More confirmations of prior locations.
- Steps47-66: many moves and turns; multiple blue sightings (local positions 3,2 / 2,2 / 1,2 / etc) consistently map to (8,4). No new unique flags.
- Steps67-77: final moves/turns; only walls reported.

Final consolidated unique flag locations found:
- purple flag at (2,11)
- red flag at (8,11)
- red flag at (1,11)
- blue flag at (8,4)
- grey flag at (6,13)

Final map summary:
&&&
a purple flag at coordinate (2,11) a red flag at coordinate (8,11) a red flag at coordinate (1,11) a blue flag at coordinate (8,4) a grey flag at coordinate (6,13).

2025-08-12 15:14:00,045 - INFO - Prompt for episode #3:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (13, 7). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.
