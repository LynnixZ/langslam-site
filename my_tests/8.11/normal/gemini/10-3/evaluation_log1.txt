You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (4, 3). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Here is my step-by-step reasoning of the robot's movement and observations.

**Initial State:**
*   Absolute Position: (4, 3)
*   Direction: West (-1, 0)
*   Map: {}

**Step-by-step analysis:**

1.  **Step 1**: Action: `left`. New direction is South (0, 1). Position: (4, 3).
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (1, -2)`.
    *   Absolute coordinates: x = 4 + 1*0 + (-2)*(-1) = 6; y = 3 + 1*1 + (-2)*0 = 4.
    *   Map update: `grey flag at (6, 4)`.

2.  **Step 2**: Action: `forward`. New position: (4, 4). Direction: South (0, 1).
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (0, -2)`. This confirms the forward move was successful.
    *   Absolute coordinates: x = 4 + 0*0 + (-2)*(-1) = 6; y = 4 + 0*1 + (-2)*0 = 4.
    *   Map check: `grey flag at (6, 4)` confirmed.

3.  **Step 3**: Action: `forward`. New position: (4, 5). Direction: South (0, 1). Move successful as no obstacle was directly in front.

4.  **Step 4**: Action: `left`. New direction: East (1, 0). Position: (4, 5).
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (2, -1)`. x = 4+2*1+(-1)*0 = 6; y = 5+2*0+(-1)*1 = 4. `grey flag at (6, 4)` confirmed.
    *   Observation: `green flag at (3, 2)`. x = 4+3*1+2*0 = 7; y = 5+3*0+2*1 = 7.
    *   Map update: `green flag at (7, 7)`.

5.  **Step 5**: Action: `left`. New direction: North (0, -1). Position: (4, 5).
    *   Observation: `blue flag at (3, 2)`. x = 4+3*0+2*(-(-1)) = 6; y = 5+3*(-1)+2*0 = 2.
    *   Map update: `blue flag at (6, 2)`.
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (1, 2)`. x = 4+1*0+2*(-(-1)) = 6; y = 5+1*(-1)+2*0 = 4. `grey flag at (6, 4)` confirmed.

6.  **Step 6**: Action: `forward`. New position: (4, 4). Direction: North (0, -1). Move confirmed by relative shift of flags.
    *   Observation: `blue flag at (2, 2)`. x = 4+2*0+2*(-(-1)) = 6; y = 4+2*(-1)+2*0 = 2. `blue flag at (6, 2)` confirmed.
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (0, 2)`. x = 4+0*0+2*(-(-1)) = 6; y = 4+0*(-1)+2*0 = 4. `grey flag at (6, 4)` confirmed.

7.  **Step 7**: Action: `right`. New direction: East (1, 0). Position: (4, 4).
    *   Observation: `blue flag at (2, -2)`. x = 4+2*1+(-2)*0 = 6; y = 4+2*0+(-2)*1 = 2. `blue flag at (6, 2)` confirmed.
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (2, 0)`. x = 4+2*1+0*0 = 6; y = 4+2*0+0*1 = 4. `grey flag at (6, 4)` confirmed.

8.  **Step 8**: Action: `forward`. The view from step 7 shows no immediate obstacle. However, if the move to (5, 4) were successful, the observed flags would be at incorrect absolute coordinates. This implies the move failed. Position remains (4, 4). Direction: East (1, 0).
    *   Observation: `blue flag at (1, -2)`. x = 4+1*1+(-2)*0 = 5; y = 4+1*0+(-2)*1 = 2.
    *   Map update: `blue flag at (5, 2)`.
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (1, 0)`. x = 4+1*1+0*0 = 5; y = 4+1*0+0*1 = 4.
    *   Map update: `grey flag at (5, 4)`.

9.  **Step 9**: Action: `left`. New direction: North (0, -1). Position: (4, 4).
    *   Observation: `blue flag at (2, 1)`. x = 4+2*0+1*(-(-1)) = 5; y = 4+2*(-1)+1*0 = 2. `blue flag at (5, 2)` confirmed.
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (0, 1)`. x = 4+0*0+1*(-(-1)) = 5; y = 4+0*(-1)+1*0 = 4. `grey flag at (5, 4)` confirmed.

16. **Step 16**: Action: `left`. New direction: South (0, 1). Position: (4, 3).

    *   Map update: `green flag at (6, 7)`. (Note: This is different from the one at (7,7)).
    *   Observation: `grey flag at (1, -1)`. x=4+1*0+(-1)*(-1)=5; y=3+1*1+(-1)*0=4. `grey flag at (5, 4)` confirmed.

    *   Observation: `green flag at (3, -2)`. x=4+3*0+(-2)*(-1)=6; y=4+3*1+(-2)*0=7. `green flag at (6, 7)` confirmed.

    *   I move West. My new position is (6 - 1, 5) = (5, 5). I see nothing.

*   **Step 5: right**
    *   My new direction is North. My position remains (5, 5). I see a yellow flag at local (3, 0). Its absolute position is (5 + (3 * 0), 5 + (3 * -1)) = (5, 2).
    *   Map: A purple flag at (8, 1), a yellow flag at (5, 2).

*   **Step 6: forward**
    *   I move North. My new position is (5, 5 - 1) = (5, 4). I see a yellow flag at local (2, 0). This confirms its position at (5 + (2 * 0), 4 + (2 * -1)) = (5, 2).

*   **Step 7: forward**
    *   I move North. My new position is (5, 4 - 1) = (5, 3). I see a yellow flag at local (1, 0). This confirms its position at (5 + (1 * 0), 3 + (1 * -1)) = (5, 2).

*   **Step 8: left**
    *   My new direction is West. My position is (5, 3). I see a yellow flag at local (0, 1). "Side 1" is one step to my right. My right is North. The object is at (5, 3 - 1) = (5, 2), confirming the yellow flag's position.

*   **Step 9: left**
    *   My new direction is South. My position is (5, 3). I see nothing.

*   **Step 10: forward**
    *   I move South. My new position is (5, 3 + 1) = (5, 4). I see nothing.

*   **Step 11: forward**
    *   I move South. My new position is (5, 4 + 1) = (5, 5). I see nothing.

*   **Step 12: forward**
    *   I move South. My new position is (5, 5 + 1) = (5, 6). I see nothing.

*   **Step 13: forward**
    *   I move South. My new position is (5, 6 + 1) = (5, 7). I see nothing.

*   **Step 14: right**
    *   My new direction is West. My position is (5, 7). I see nothing.

*   **Step 15: right**
    *   My new direction is North. My position is (5, 7). I see nothing.

*   **Step 16: right**
    *   My new direction is East. My position is (5, 7). I see a red flag at local (3, 1). Its absolute position is calculated by moving 3 steps forward (East) and 1 step right (South): (5 + 3, 7 + 1) = (8, 8).
    *   Map: A purple flag at (8, 1), a yellow flag at (5, 2), a red flag at (8, 8).

*   **Step 17: forward**
    *   I move East. My new position is (5 + 1, 7) = (6, 7). I see a red flag at local (2, 1). This confirms its position at (6 + 2, 7 + 1) = (8, 8).

*   **Step 18: forward**
    *   I move East. My new position is (6 + 1, 7) = (7, 7). I see a red flag at local (1, 1). This confirms its position at (7 + 1, 7 + 1) = (8, 8).

*   **Step 19: forward**
    *   I move East. My new position is (7 + 1, 7) = (8, 7). I see a red flag at local (0, 1). My right is South. The object is at (8, 7 + 1) = (8, 8), confirming its position.

*   **Step 20: right**
    *   My new direction is South. My position is (8, 7). I see a red flag at local (1, 0). This confirms its position at (8, 7 + 1) = (8, 8).
