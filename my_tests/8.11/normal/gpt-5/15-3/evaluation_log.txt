You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (4, 9). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

Reasoning:
- Start at absolute (4,9), facing West. Turn left to face South (Step1).
- Move around; only record steps where flags appear and convert local (Depth, Side) to absolute using:
  East: (x + d, y + s); West: (x - d, y - s); North: (x + s, y - d); South: (x - s, y + d).
- Step11: at (4,5) facing North, grey flag (4,2) -> (6,1).
- Step14: (5,5) North, grey (4,1) -> (6,1).
- Step15: (5,4) North, grey (3,1) -> (6,1).
- Step18: (6,4) North, grey (3,0) -> (6,1).
- Step19: (6,3) North, grey (2,0) -> (6,1).
- Step20: (6,3) East, grey (0,-2) -> (6,1).
- Step33: (8,10) North, grey (3,-1) -> (7,7).
- Step34: (8,9) North, grey (2,-1) -> (7,7).
- Step35: (8,8) North, grey (1,-1) -> (7,7).
- Step36: (8,8) West, grey (1,1) -> (7,7).
- Step37: (7,8) West, grey (0,1) -> (7,7).
- Step40: (5,8) North, grey (1,2) -> (7,7).
- Step41: (5,7) North, grey (0,2) -> (7,7).
- Step43: (4,7) West, red (4,2) -> (0,5).
- Step44: (3,7) West, red (3,2) -> (0,5).
- Step46: (3,7) West, red (3,2) -> (0,5).
- Step47: (2,7) West, red (2,2) -> (0,5).
- Step48: (1,7) West, red (1,2) -> (0,5).
- Step50: (1,8) South, grey (4,2) -> (-1,12).
- Step51: (1,9) South, grey (3,2) -> (-1,12).
- Step52: (1,10) South, grey (2,2) -> (-1,12).
- Step53: (1,11) South, grey (1,2) -> (-1,12).
- Step54: (1,12) South, grey (0,2) -> (-1,12).
- Steps77–80: around (7,11) to (7,8) facing North, grey (4,0),(3,0),(2,0),(1,0) -> (7,7).

Final, unique flags mapped:
- Grey flags at (6,1), (7,7), (-1,12).
- Red flag at (0,5).

&&&
a grey flag at coordinate (6,1) a grey flag at coordinate (7,7) a grey flag at coordinate (-1,12) a red flag at coordinate (0,5).

Reasoning:
- Start at absolute (9,1), facing East. I updated my absolute position and facing after each movement. A forward move always succeeded since no wall was ever observed at depth 1, side 0.
- I converted each flagged local coordinate (depth d, side s) to absolute coordinates using:
  - Facing East: (x+d, y+s)
  - Facing West: (x−d, y−s)
  - Facing North: (x+s, y−d)
  - Facing South: (x−s, y+d)
- Consolidated unique flag positions from all sightings:

Key sightings and conversions (duplicates omitted):

2025-08-12 06:06:55,075 - INFO - Prompt for episode #2:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (6, 7). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.




### OBSERVATION LOG ###
Initial Observation: You're facing South. You see nothing of interest..
Step1: right.  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (4, -2), (3, -2), (2, -2), (1, -2), (0, -2).
Step2: forward.  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (4, -2), (3, -2), (2, -2), (1, -2), (0, -2).
Step3: forward.  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (4, -2), (3, -2), (2, -2), (1, -2), (0, -2), (4, -1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2).
Step4: right.  You can see a grey flag at coordinate (4, -2).

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Start: pos (6,12), facing South. Nothing seen.
- Step1: right -> facing West, pos (6,12). Walls only (ignored).
- Step2: forward -> pos (5,12), facing West. Walls only.
- Step3: forward -> pos (4,12), facing West. Walls only.
- Step4: right -> facing North, pos (4,12). Grey flag at local (4,-2) => global (2,8).
- Step5: forward -> pos (4,11), facing North. Grey flag at (3,-2) => (2,8).
- Step6: forward -> pos (4,10), facing North. Grey flag at (2,-2) => (2,8).
- Step7: forward -> pos (4,9), facing North. Grey flag at (1,-2) => (2,8).
- Step8: forward -> pos (4,8), facing North. Grey flag at (0,-2) => (2,8).
- Step9: right -> facing East, pos (4,8). Nothing.
- Step10: forward -> pos (5,8), facing East. Nothing.
- Step11: forward -> pos (6,8), facing East. Nothing.
- Step12: left -> facing North, pos (6,8). Nothing.
- Step13: right -> facing East, pos (6,8). Nothing.
- Step14: forward -> pos (7,8), facing East. Blue flag at local (4,2) => global (11,10).
- Step15: forward -> pos (8,8), facing East. Blue flag at (3,2) => (11,10).
- Step16: left -> facing North, pos (8,8). Red flag at (3,1) => (9,5).
- Step17: forward -> pos (8,7), facing North. Red flag at (2,1) => (9,5).
- Step18: right -> facing East, pos (8,7). Red flag at (1,-2) => (9,5).
- Step19: forward -> pos (9,7), facing East. Red flag at (0,-2) => (9,5).
- Step20: left -> facing North, pos (9,7). Red flag at (2,0) => (9,5).
- Step21: forward -> pos (9,6), facing North. Red flag at (1,0) => (9,5).
- Step22: right -> facing East, pos (9,6). Red flag at (0,-1) => (9,5).
- Step23: left -> facing North, pos (9,6). Red flag at (1,0) => (9,5).
- Step24: forward -> pos (9,5), facing North. Nothing.
