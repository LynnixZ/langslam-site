You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (5, 5). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To build a consistent 2D map of the room, I start at absolute position (5, 5) facing East. I process each step from the observation log, updating my position and direction based on movements, and converting local view coordinates to absolute positions when flags are observed. Walls are ignored as per the task. The absolute coordinate system has:
- East increasing the first dimension (x).
- South increasing the second dimension (y).

**Key Definitions for Movement and Local View Conversion:**
- **Directions and Movement:**
  - Facing East: Forward → Δx = +1, Δy = 0
  - Facing South: Forward → Δx = 0, Δy = +1
  - Facing West: Forward → Δx = -1, Δy = 0
  - Facing North: Forward → Δx = 0, Δy = -1
  - Turns (left, right, turnaround) change facing but not position.
- **Local View to Absolute Coordinates:**
  - For a local coordinate (d, s) at current position (x, y) facing a direction:
    - `dir_vec` is the unit vector for the facing direction.
    - `right_vec` is the unit vector for the right direction (90° clockwise from facing).
    - Absolute position = (x, y) + d × `dir_vec` + s × `right_vec`
  - `dir_vec` and `right_vec` by facing:
    - East: `dir_vec` = (1, 0), `right_vec` = (0, 1)  // South
    - South: `dir_vec` = (0, 1), `right_vec` = (-1, 0) // West
    - West: `dir_vec` = (-1, 0), `right_vec` = (0, -1) // North
    - North: `dir_vec` = (0, -1), `right_vec` = (1, 0)  // East

**Position and Direction Tracking Through Steps:**
- Start: Position (5, 5), facing East.
- Process each step, updating position and direction. Only flag observations are recorded; walls are ignored.
- Flag observations are converted to absolute coordinates using the above method.

**Detailed Step Processing (Only Flag Observations):**
- **Step2:** At (5, 6), facing South. See purple flag at local (4, 2).  
  Absolute: (5, 6) + 4 × (0, 1) + 2 × (-1, 0) = (5, 6) + (0, 4) + (-2, 0) = (3, 10) → **Purple flag at (3, 10)**.
- **Step3:** At (5, 7), facing South. See purple flag at local (3, 2).  
  Absolute: (5, 7) + 3 × (0, 1) + 2 × (-1, 0) = (5, 7) + (0, 3) + (-2, 0) = (3, 10) → Confirms purple flag at (3, 10).
- **Step22:** At (9, 6), facing North. See yellow flag at local (4, 2).  
  Absolute: (9, 6) + 4 × (0, -1) + 2 × (1, 0) = (9, 6) + (0, -4) + (2, 0) = (11, 2) → **Yellow flag at (11, 2)**.
- **Step23:** At (9, 5), facing North. See yellow flag at local (3, 2).  
  Absolute: (9, 5) + 3 × (0, -1) + 2 × (1, 0) = (9, 5) + (0, -3) + (2, 0) = (11, 2) → Confirms yellow flag at (11, 2).
- **Step24:** At (9, 4), facing North. See yellow flag at local (2, 2).  
  Absolute: (9, 4) + 2 × (0, -1) + 2 × (1, 0) = (9, 4) + (0, -2) + (2, 0) = (11, 2) → Confirms yellow flag at (11, 2).
- **Step25:** At (9, 3), facing North. See yellow flag at local (1, 2).  
  Absolute: (9, 3) + 1 × (0, -1) + 2 × (1, 0) = (9, 3) + (0, -1) + (2, 0) = (11, 2) → Confirms yellow flag at (11, 2).
- **Step26:** At (9, 3), facing East. See green flag at local (4, -2) and yellow flag at local (2, -1).  
  - Green: (9, 3) + 4 × (1, 0) + (-2) × (0, 1) = (9, 3) + (4, 0) + (0, -2) = (13, 1) → **Green flag at (13, 1)**.
  - Yellow: (9, 3) + 2 × (1, 0) + (-1) × (0, 1) = (9, 3) + (2, 0) + (0, -1) = (11, 2) → Confirms yellow flag at (11, 2).
- **Step28:** At (9, 3), facing West. See grey flag at local (3, 2).  
  Absolute: (9, 3) + 3 × (-1, 0) + 2 × (0, -1) = (9, 3) + (-3, 0) + (0, -2) = (6, 1) → **Grey flag at (6, 1)**.
- **Step29:** At (8, 3), facing West. See grey flag at local (2, 2).  
  Absolute: (8, 3) + 2 × (-1, 0) + 2 × (0, -1) = (8, 3) + (-2, 0) + (0, -2) = (6, 1) → Confirms grey flag at (6, 1).
- **Step44:** At (3, 6), facing South. See purple flag at local (4, 0).  
  Absolute: (3, 6) + 4 × (0, 1) + 0 × (-1, 0) = (3, 6) + (0, 4) = (3, 10) → Confirms purple flag at (3, 10).
- **Step45:** At (3, 7), facing South. See purple flag at local (3, 0).  
  Absolute: (3, 7) + 3 × (0, 1) + 0 × (-1, 0) = (3, 7) + (0, 3) = (3, 10) → Confirms purple flag at (3, 10).
- **Step46:** At (3, 8), facing South. See purple flag at local (2, 0).  
  Absolute: (3, 8) + 2 × (0, 1) + 0 × (-1, 0) = (3, 8) + (0, 2) = (3, 10) → Confirms purple flag at (3, 10).
- **Step47:** At (3, 9), facing South. See purple flag at local (1, 0).  
  Absolute: (3, 9) + 1 × (0, 1) + 0 × (-1, 0) = (3, 9) + (0, 1) = (3, 10) → Confirms purple flag at (3, 10).
- **Step51:** At (4, 10), facing North. See purple flag at local (0, -1).  
  Absolute: (4, 10) + 0 × (0, -1) + (-1) × (1, 0) = (4, 10) + (0, 0) + (-1, 0) = (3, 10) → Confirms purple flag at (3, 10).
- **Step58:** At (9, 9), facing East. See blue flag at local (4, 2).  
  Absolute: (9, 9) + 4 × (1, 0) + 2 × (0, 1) = (9, 9) + (4, 0) + (0, 2) = (13, 11) → **Blue flag at (13, 11)**.
- **Step59:** At (10, 9), facing East. See blue flag at local (3, 2).  
  Absolute: (10, 9) + 3 × (1, 0) + 2 × (0, 1) = (10, 9) + (3, 0) + (0, 2) = (13, 11) → Confirms blue flag at (13, 11).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To build a consistent 2D map of the room, I processed the observation log step by step, tracking my absolute position and facing direction. I ignored all wall observations, focusing only on flag sightings. The flags are recorded with their colors and absolute coordinates (x, y), where:
- x increases East (first dimension).
- y increases South (second dimension).

My starting position was (4, 13), facing South. For each action (left, right, forward), I updated my position and facing. When flags were observed in the local (Depth, Side) view, I converted them to absolute coordinates based on my current position and facing using the following conversions:
- **Facing East**:  
  abs_x = x + Depth  
  abs_y = y + Side
- **Facing South**:  
  abs_x = x - Side  
  abs_y = y + Depth
- **Facing West**:  
  abs_x = x - Depth  
  abs_y = y - Side
- **Facing North**:  
  abs_x = x + Side  
  abs_y = y - Depth

For local coordinates with Depth = 0, the flag is at my current position (x, y), regardless of Side.

After processing all steps, I compiled all unique flag sightings. Duplicate sightings of the same flag at the same position were ignored, as they refer to the same object. The resulting map includes all flags with their colors and absolute coordinates.

#### Flag Sightings from Log:
- **Grey flags**: Observed at (11,10), (12,13), (13,6), (12,6), (12,10), (12,12), (11,12)
- **Purple flags**: Observed at (11,7), (12,7)
- **Yellow flags**: Observed at (3,10), (3,8), (4,10), (3,12)

All flag positions are unique and consistent across observations.

### Final Map Summary

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (12, 4). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To build a consistent map of the room, I need to track my absolute position and direction at each step, convert local (depth, side) observations of flags to absolute coordinates, and compile all unique flags. Walls are ignored as per the task. The conversion from local (d, s) to absolute (x, y) depends on my facing direction, using the following rules:
- **Facing East**: abs_x = my_x + d, abs_y = my_y + s
- **Facing West**: abs_x = my_x - d, abs_y = my_y - s
- **Facing North**: abs_x = my_x + s, abs_y = my_y - d
- **Facing South**: abs_x = my_x - s, abs_y = my_y + d

I start at position (12, 4) facing East. I process each step in the log, updating my position and direction based on actions, and record flag sightings with their absolute positions. If a "forward" action is taken while facing a wall (indicated by seeing walls at depth 1 or less after the move), the position does not change, but the log does not always explicitly state this. I infer successful movement based on consistent flag observations and depth changes.

Key flag sightings from the log (after conversion to absolute coordinates):
- **Step 11**: Facing West at (9,4), grey flag at (4,1) → (5,3); yellow flag at (3,2) → (6,2)
- **Step 12**: Facing West at (8,4), grey flag at (3,1) → (5,3); yellow flag at (2,2) → (6,2) (confirms previous)
- **Step 17**: Facing South at (9,5), purple flag at (4,2) → (7,9)
- **Step 18**: Facing South at (9,6), purple flag at (3,2) → (7,9) (confirms)
- **Step 24**: Facing South at (10,9), red flag at (4,-1) → (11,13)
- **Step 25**: Facing West at (10,9), purple flag at (3,0) → (7,9) (confirms)
- **Step 28**: Facing West at (10,8), purple flag at (3,-1) → (7,9) (confirms)
- **Step 29**: Facing West at (9,8), purple flag at (2,-1) → (7,9) (confirms)
- **Step 30**: Facing West at (8,8), purple flag at (1,-1) → (7,9) (confirms)
- **Step 31**: Facing West at (7,8), purple flag at (0,-1) → (7,9) (confirms; d=0,s=-1 interpreted as adjacent cell)
- **Step 35**: Facing North at (5,7), grey flag at (4,0) → (5,3) (confirms)
- **Step 36**: Facing North at (5,6), grey flag at (3,0) → (5,3); yellow flag at (4,1) → (6,2) (confirms)
- **Step 39**: Facing North at (4,6), grey flag at (3,1) → (5,3); yellow flag at (4,2) → (6,2) (confirms)
- **Step 40**: Facing North at (4,5), grey flag at (2,1) → (5,3); yellow flag at (3,2) → (6,2) (confirms)
- **Step 41**: Facing North at (4,4), grey flag at (1,1) → (5,3); yellow flag at (2,2) → (6,2) (confirms)
- **Step 42**: Facing North at (4,3), grey flag at (0,1) → (5,3); yellow flag at (1,2) → (6,2) (confirms)
- **Step 45**: Facing South at (3,3), grey flag at (0,-2) → (5,3) (confirms; d=0,s=-2 interpreted)
- **Step 59**: Facing East at (7,12), red flag at (4,1) → (11,13) (confirms)
- **Step 60**: Facing East at (8,12), red flag at (3,1) → (11,13) (confirms)
- **Step 61**: Facing South at (8,12), yellow flag at (2,-2) → (10,14) (new flag)
- **Step 63**: Facing North at (8,12), purple flag at (3,-1) → (7,9) (confirms)
- **Step 64**: Facing East at (8,12), red flag at (3,1) → (11,13) (confirms)
- **Step 65**: Facing East at (9,12), blue flag at (4,0) → (13,12); red flag at (2,1) → (11,13) (blue is new)
- **Step 66**: Facing East at (10,12), blue flag at (3,0) → (13,12); red flag at (1,1) → (11,13) (confirms blue and red)
- **Step 69**: Facing East at (10,11), blue flag at (3,1) → (13,12); red flag at (1,2) → (11,13) (confirms)
- **Step 70**: Facing East at (11,11), blue flag at (2,1) → (13,12); red flag at (0,2) → (11,13) (confirms)
- **Step 73**: Facing East at (11,10), blue flag at (2,2) → (13,12) (confirms)
- **Step 74**: Facing East at (12,10), blue flag at (1,2) → (13,12) (confirms)
- **Step 75**: Facing South at (12,10), blue flag at (2,-1) → (13,12); red flag at (3,1) → (11,13) (confirms)

Unique flags and positions:
- Grey flag at (5, 3)
- Yellow flag at (6, 2)
- Purple flag at (7, 9)
- Red flag at (11, 13)
- Blue flag at (13, 12)
- Yellow flag at (10, 14) (second yellow flag)

The map includes all these flags, with two distinct yellow flags at different positions.

### Final Map Summary
&&&
a grey flag at (5,3) a yellow flag at (6,2) a purple flag at (7,9) a red flag at (11,13) a blue flag at (13,12) a yellow flag at (10,14).

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (12, 12). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### Reasoning Step by Step

I start at absolute position (12, 12), facing South. I need to track my position and direction through each step, converting any flag observations from the relative (Depth, Side) coordinate system to absolute coordinates. I ignore walls as per the instructions. Flags are observed at specific steps, and I record their absolute positions and colors, ensuring consistency by noting that multiple observations may refer to the same flag.

#### Initial State
- Position: (12, 12)
- Facing: South (forward increases y, left is East/increasing x, right is West/decreasing x)

#### Unique Flag Positions
From all observations, the unique flag positions and colors are:
- Blue at (7, 8)
- Red at (8, 8)
- Blue at (7, 10)
- Red at (8, 10)
- Yellow at (10, 3)
- Red at (2, 10)
- Red at (2, 12)
- Blue at (7, 14)
- Red at (8, 14)
- Red at (2, 18)

The map includes all these flags, as they are consistent across multiple observations.

### Final Map Summary

2025-08-12 22:25:49,767 - INFO - Prompt for episode #4:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (12, 13). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.




### OBSERVATION LOG ###
Initial Observation: You're facing South. You see nothing of interest..

### Reasoning Step by Step

I start at absolute position (12, 13) facing South. I need to track my position and direction throughout the steps, converting local observations (depth, side) to absolute coordinates (x, y) using the facing direction at each step. Walls are ignored as per the task. Only flags are recorded for the map.

- **Coordinate System**: 
  - Absolute position (x, y): East increases x, South increases y.
  - Facing direction affects local-to-absolute conversion:
    - Facing South: Forward vector F = (0, 1), Right vector R = (-1, 0) (right is West).
    - Facing North: F = (0, -1), R = (1, 0) (right is East).
    - Facing East: F = (1, 0), R = (0, 1) (right is South).
    - Facing West: F = (-1, 0), R = (0, -1) (right is North).
  - Local (d, s) to absolute: Position = current position + d × F + s × R.

- **Flag Observations**:
  - From Step1 to Step110, flags are observed at specific steps. After processing all steps, the unique flags and their absolute positions are:
    - Grey flag at (9, 13): Seen in Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 28, and 79.
    - Green flag at (3, 13): Seen in Steps 12, 75, 76, 77, and 78.
    - Purple flag at (13, 9): Seen in Steps 16, 17, 22, and 23.
    - Yellow flag at (1, 11): Seen in Steps 34, 35, 36, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, and 81.
    - Yellow flag at (1, 3): Seen in Steps 65, 66, 67, 68, and 69.

- **Consistency Check**: All observations of the same color at the same position are consistent (e.g., grey at (9,13) appears multiple times but is the same flag). Two distinct yellow flags exist at different positions. No other flags are observed.

- **Final Map**: The map contains 5 flags: one grey, one green, one purple, and two yellow at their respective positions.

### Final Map Summary
&&&
a grey flag at coordinate (9,13) a green flag at coordinate (3,13) a purple flag at coordinate (13,9) a yellow flag at coordinate (1,11) a yellow flag at coordinate (1,3).

2025-08-13 00:06:13,242 - INFO - Prompt for episode #5:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (3, 2). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To build a consistent 2D map, I need to track the agent's absolute position and direction at each step, then convert local view coordinates of flags to absolute coordinates using the agent's current state. Walls are ignored as per the task. The agent starts at position (3, 2) facing South. The coordinate system defines East as increasing the first dimension and South as increasing the second dimension.

#### Key Rules for Conversion:
- **Facing East**: `x_abs = x_agent + depth`, `y_abs = y_agent + side`
- **Facing South**: `x_abs = x_agent - side`, `y_abs = y_agent + depth`
- **Facing West**: `x_abs = x_agent - depth`, `y_abs = y_agent - side`
- **Facing North**: `x_abs = x_agent + side`, `y_abs = y_agent - depth`

#### Position and Direction Tracking:
- **Initial**: Position (3, 2), facing South.
- Steps are processed sequentially, updating position and direction based on actions:
  - `forward`: Moves +1 in the facing direction (East: +x, South: +y, West: -x, North: -y), but only if not blocked by a wall (walls are observed but do not affect position if movement is attempted and blocked; in this log, all `forward` actions succeeded unless walls were directly in front, but no such case occurred here).
  - `left`, `right`, `turnaround` (not used): Changes direction without moving.
- Observations of flags are converted to absolute coordinates using the current position and facing direction.

#### Flag Observations:
Flags are recorded only when explicitly mentioned in the observation (e.g., "purple flag"). Multiple observations of the same flag at the same absolute coordinate are consolidated. The log contains flags at the following absolute positions:
- **Step 12**: Purple flag at local (4, -2). Agent at (6, 6) facing East → Absolute: (10, 4).
- **Step 15**: Purple flag at local (4, -1) → (10, 4); Grey flag at local (4, 1) → (10, 6).
- **Step 16**: Purple flag at local (3, -1) → (10, 4); Grey flag at local (4, 1) → (11, 6).
- **Step 17**: Purple flag at local (2, -1) → (10, 4); Grey flag at local (3, 1) → (11, 6).
- **Step 22**: Purple flag at local (4, 2). Agent at (8, 9) facing South → Absolute: (6, 13).
- **Step 23**: Purple flag at local (3, 2) → (6, 13).
- **Step 49**: Purple flag at local (4, 1). Agent at (6, 3) facing East → Absolute: (10, 4).
- **Step 50**: Blue flag at local (4, -2) → (11, 1); Purple flag at local (3, 1) → (10, 4).
- **Step 51**: Blue flag at local (3, -2) → (11, 1); Purple flag at local (2, 1) → (10, 4).
- **Step 52**: Blue flag at local (2, -2) → (11, 1); Purple flag at local (1, 1) → (10, 4).
- **Step 53**: Grey flag at local (3, -2) → (11, 6); Purple flag at local (1, -1) → (10, 4).
- **Step 54**: Grey flag at local (2, -2) → (11, 6); Purple flag at local (0, -1) → (10, 4).
- **Step 55**: Purple flag at local (1, 0) → (10, 4); Grey flag at local (2, 2) → (11, 6).
- **Step 56**: Grey flag at local (1, 2) → (11, 6).
- **Step 57**: Grey flag at local (0, 2) → (11, 6).
- **Step 58**: Grey flag at local (2, 0) → (11, 6); Purple flag at local (0, 1) → (10, 4).
- **Step 59**: Grey flag at local (1, 0) → (11, 6).
- **Step 60**: Green flag at local (4, -2). Agent at (11, 6) facing South → Absolute: (13, 10).
- **Step 61**: Green flag at local (3, -2) → (13, 10).
- **Step 62**: Green flag at local (2, -2) → (13, 10).
- **Step 63**: Green flag at local (1, -2) → (13, 10).
- **Step 67**: Grey flag at local (3, 2). Agent at (9, 9) facing North → Absolute: (11, 6).
- **Step 68**: Purple flag at local (4, 1) → (10, 4); Grey flag at local (2, 2) → (11, 6).
- **Step 69**: Purple flag at local (3, 1) → (10, 4); Grey flag at local (1, 2) → (11, 6).

#### Unique Flags in the Map:
- Purple flag at (10, 4): Observed in Steps 12, 15, 16, 17, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 58, 68, 69.
- Grey flag at (10, 6): Observed only in Step 15. Not seen again, but included as per the log.
- Grey flag at (11, 6): Observed in Steps 16, 17, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 67, 68, 69.
- Blue flag at (11, 1): Observed in Steps 50, 51, 52.
- Purple flag at (6, 13): Observed in Steps 22, 23.
- Green flag at (13, 10): Observed in Steps 60, 61, 62, 63.

No other flags were observed. The map includes all unique flag positions and colors from the log.

#### Final Map Summary:
The consistent 2D map includes the following flags:
- Purple flag at (10, 4)
- Grey flag at (10, 6)
- Grey flag at (11, 6)
- Blue flag at (11, 1)

2025-08-13 02:18:19,060 - INFO - Prompt for episode #6:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (5, 6). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### Reasoning Step by Step

I am reconstructing the map based on the observation log, starting from the initial position (5, 6) facing South. I track my absolute position and direction after each action, converting relative (Depth, Side) coordinates to absolute (x, y) coordinates for flags. Walls are neglected as per the task. The coordinate system:
- East increases x, South increases y.
- Facing direction affects coordinate conversion:
  - South: (d, s) → (x + s, y + d)
  - East: (d, s) → (x + d, y + s)
  - North: (d, s) → (x + s, y - d)
  - West: (d, s) → (x - d, y + s)
- For depth 0, (0, s) always corresponds to the current position (x, y), regardless of s.
- All forward moves are assumed successful since no blocked moves are explicitly indicated in the log (no walls at depth 1 reported immediately after forward actions).

I process the log step-by-step, recording flags and their absolute positions. After deduplication, the consistent flag positions and colors are:

- Grey flag at (1, 8): Seen at Step38 (facing South, (2, -2) from (3,6)), Step39 (facing South, (1, -2) from (3,7)).
- Grey flag at (2, 1): Seen at Step69 (facing West, (4, -2) from (6,3)).
- Grey flag at (2, 3): Seen at Step28 (facing West, (4, -1) from (6,4)), Step29 (facing West, (3, -1) from (5,4)).
- Grey flag at (2, 5): Seen at Step32 (facing West, (3, 0) from (5,5)), Step33 (facing West, (2, 0) from (4,5)).
- Grey flag at (2, 7): Seen at Step36 (facing West, (2, 1) from (4,6)), Step37 (facing West, (1, 1) from (3,6)).
- Grey flag at (3, 8): Seen at Step34 (facing South, (3, -1) from (4,5)), Step35 (facing South, (2, -1) from (4,6)).
- Grey flag at (4, 5): Seen at Step34 (facing South, (0, 2) from (4,5)).
- Grey flag at (5, 6): Seen at Step1 (facing East, (0, 2) from (5,6)).
- Grey flag at (5, 8): Seen at Initial Observation (facing South, (2, 0) from (5,6)), Step3 (facing South, (2, 1) from (6,6) → (7,8) is different), Step30 (facing South, (4, 0) from (5,4)), Step31 (facing South, (3, 0) from (5,5)).
- Grey flag at (5, 9): Seen at Step44 (facing East, (0, -1) from (5,9)).
- Grey flag at (6, 8): Seen at Step5 (facing South, (0, 1) from (6,8)).
- Grey flag at (7, 8): Seen at Step3 (facing South, (2, 1) from (6,6)), Step4 (facing South, (1, 1) from (6,7)).
- Grey flag at (13, 3): Seen at Step23 (facing East, (4, -1) from (9,4)), Step57 (facing North, (4, 2) from (11,7)), Step58 (facing North, (3, 2) from (11,6)), Step59 (facing North, (2, 2) from (11,5)), Step92 (facing North, (2, 2) from estimated (11,5) after moves).
- Green flag at (1, 3): Seen at Step29 (facing West, (4, -1) from (5,4)).
- Green flag at (1, 5): Seen at Step32 (facing West, (4, 0) from (5,5)), Step33 (facing West, (3, 0) from (4,5)).
- Green flag at (1, 7): Seen at Step36 (facing West, (3, 1) from (4,6)), Step37 (facing West, (2, 1) from (3,6)).
- Yellow flag at (2, 11): Seen at Step39 (facing South, (4, -1) from (3,7)), Step40 (facing South, (3, -1) from (3,8)), Step41 (facing South, (2, -1) from (3,9)).
- Yellow flag at (4, 9): Seen at Step43 (facing East, (0, 2) from (4,9)).
- Yellow flag at (4, 11): Seen at Step42 (facing East, (1, 2) from (3,9)).
- Yellow flag at (8, 11): Seen at Step4 (facing South, (4, 2) from (6,7)), Step5 (facing South, (3, 2) from (6,8)), Step6 (facing South, (2, 2) from (6,9)).

Step93 (after right turn) shows a grey flag at (2, -2), but based on the position and facing (estimated (11,5) facing East after turning right from North), it resolves to (13, 3), which is already recorded. No new flags are added.

The final map includes all unique flag positions from the log.

2025-08-13 02:34:32,604 - INFO - Prompt for episode #7:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (12, 12). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

I start at absolute position (12, 12), facing South. The grid uses (x, y) coordinates where:
- x increases East (right)
- y increases South (down)

I process each step in the log, updating my position and facing based on movements and turns. I convert local (Depth, Side) observations to absolute coordinates only for flags (ignoring walls). The conversion depends on my facing direction:
- **Facing North (y decreases)**: (d, s) → (x + s, y - d)
- **Facing East (x increases)**: (d, s) → (x + d, y + s)
- **Facing South (y increases)**: (d, s) → (x - s, y + d)
- **Facing West (x decreases)**: (d, s) → (x - d, y - s)

For depth 0, (0, s) corresponds to my current position (x, y), as it is the cell I occupy.

#### Initial State
- Position: (12, 12)
- Facing: South

#### Summary of Flag Positions
From all observations, the unique flag positions and colors are:
- Blue flag at (1, 8)
- Grey flag at (3, 8)
- Grey flag at (5, 8)
- Blue flag at (8, 4)
- Blue flag at (10, 4)
- Blue flag at (10, 5)
- Yellow flag at (13, 4)
- Yellow flag at (2, 12)
- Yellow flag at (13, 3)

These are all consistent observations, with no conflicts (each position has one color).

2025-08-13 03:23:08,363 - INFO - Prompt for episode #8:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (6, 9). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.

2025-08-13 03:58:13,738 - INFO - Prompt for episode #9:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (8, 13). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
You will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them. However, if you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.
