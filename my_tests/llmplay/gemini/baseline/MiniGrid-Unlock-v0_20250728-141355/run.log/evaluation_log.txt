You are an intelligent agent in a grid-based video game. Your goal is to navigate and interact with objects to solve a mission.
Your Mission is to open the door.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a single, continuous map which may contain multiple rooms connected by doors.
2.  A change in your view means you have moved or turned, NOT that you have entered a new, separate room.
3.  You can only interact with objects that are directly in front of you. You cannot toggle the wall.

### ACTION HISTORY LOG (Last 10 Steps) ###
Initial Observation:  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (3, -3), (2, -3), (1, -3), (0, -3), (3, -2), (3, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), a green key at coordinate (1, -2). Let's go!

Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing if there is no wall in front of you.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).

Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example: 
[forward]

If you are certain about what to do, you can select a sequence of actions, for example,
[forward, right, forward, forward, pickup, right]
But you don't have to rush. Remember turning or moving will give you a new view and new information!

You are an intelligent agent in a grid-based video game. Your goal is to navigate and interact with objects to solve a mission.
Your Mission is to open the door.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a single, continuous map which may contain multiple rooms connected by doors.
2.  A change in your view means you have moved or turned, NOT that you have entered a new, separate room.
3.  You can only interact with objects that are directly in front of you. You cannot toggle the wall.

### ACTION HISTORY LOG (Last 10 Steps) ###
Initial Observation:  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (3, -3), (2, -3), (1, -3), (0, -3), (3, -2), (3, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), a green key at coordinate (1, -2). Let's go!
Turn 1: Action: ['forward']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (2, -3), (1, -3), (0, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), a green key at coordinate (0, -2)'.
Turn 2: Action: ['left']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (3, -3), (2, -3), (1, -3), (0, -3), (3, -2), (3, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), a green key at coordinate (2, 0)'.
Turn 3: Action: ['forward']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (2, -3), (1, -3), (0, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), a green key at coordinate (1, 0)'.
Turn 4: Action: ['pickup']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (2, -3), (1, -3), (0, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), a green key at coordinate (0, 0)'.
Turn 5: Action: ['right']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (2, -2), (1, -2), (0, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), a green key at coordinate (0, 0)'.
Turn 6: Action: ['forward']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (1, -2), (0, -2), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 3), a green key at coordinate (0, 0)'.
Turn 7: Action: ['right']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (3, -1), (2, -1), (1, -1), (0, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), a green key at coordinate (0, 0)'.

Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing if there is no wall in front of you.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).

Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example: 
[forward]

If you are certain about what to do, you can select a sequence of actions, for example,
[forward, right, forward, forward, pickup, right]
But you don't have to rush. Remember turning or moving will give you a new view and new information!
