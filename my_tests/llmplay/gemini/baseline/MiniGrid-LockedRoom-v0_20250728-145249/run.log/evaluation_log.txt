You are an intelligent agent in a grid-based video game. Your goal is to navigate and interact with objects to solve a mission.
Your Mission is to get the purple key from the green room, unlock the purple door and go to the goal.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-3-3)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a single, continuous map which may contain multiple rooms connected by doors.
2.  A change in your view means you have moved or turned, NOT that you have entered a new, separate room.
3.  You can only interact with objects that are directly in front of you. You cannot toggle the wall.
4.  Everything you need may not be visible in your current view. You can move yourself and explore the world to find all objects.
### ACTION HISTORY LOG (Last 10 Steps) ###
Initial Observation:  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (6, -1), (5, -1), (4, -1), (3, -1), (2, -1), (0, -1), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (0, 3), a green door at coordinate (1, -1) It is closed., a yellow door at coordinate (1, 3) It is closed.. Let's go!

Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing if there is no wall in front of you.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).

Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example: 
[forward]

If you are certain about what to do, you can select a sequence of actions, for example,
[forward, right, forward, forward, pickup, right]
But you don't have to rush. Remember turning or moving will give you a new view and new information!

3.  You can only interact with objects that are directly in front of you. You cannot toggle the wall.
4.  Everything you need may not be visible in your current view. You can move yourself and explore the world to find all objects.
### ACTION HISTORY LOG (Last 10 Steps) ###
Initial Observation:  You can see grey walls at coordinates: (6, -1), (5, -1), (4, -1), (3, -1), (2, -1), (0, -1), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (0, 3), a green door at coordinate (1, -1) It is closed., a yellow door at coordinate (1, 3) It is closed.. Let's go!
Turn 1: Action: ['forward']. Saw ' You can see a red door at coordinate (6, -1) It is closed., grey walls at coordinates: (5, -1), (4, -1), (3, -1), (2, -1), (1, -1), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), a green door at coordinate (0, -1) It is closed., a grey door at coordinate (6, 3) It is closed., a yellow door at coordinate (0, 3) It is closed.'.
Turn 2: Action: ['left']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (1, -3), (1, -2), (1, -1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), a green door at coordinate (1, 0) It is closed.'.
Turn 3: Action: ['toggle']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (6, -3), (5, -3), (4, -3), (3, -3), (2, -3), (1, -3), (1, -2), (1, -1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), a purple key at coordinate (4, 0), a green door at coordinate (1, 0) It is open.'.
Turn 4: Action: ['forward', 'forward', 'forward', 'pickup']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (5, -3), (4, -3), (3, -3), (2, -3), (1, -3), (0, -3), (5, -2), (5, -1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), a purple key at coordinate (0, 0)'.
Turn 5: Action: ['left', 'left', 'forward', 'forward', 'forward']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (3, -3), (3, -2), (3, -1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), a yellow door at coordinate (3, 0) It is closed., a purple key at coordinate (0, 0)'.
Turn 6: Action: ['forward', 'forward']. Saw ' You can see grey walls at coordinates: (1, -3), (1, -2), (1, -1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), a yellow door at coordinate (1, 0) It is closed., a purple key at coordinate (0, 0)'.

Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing if there is no wall in front of you.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).

Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example: 
[forward]

If you are certain about what to do, you can select a sequence of actions, for example,
[forward, right, forward, forward, pickup, right]
But you don't have to rush. Remember turning or moving will give you a new view and new information!

You are an intelligent agent in a grid-based video game. Your goal is to navigate and interact with objects to solve a mission.
Your Mission is to get the purple key from the green room, unlock the purple door and go to the goal.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (-3-3)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a single, continuous map which may contain multiple rooms connected by doors.
2.  A change in your view means you have moved or turned, NOT that you have entered a new, separate room.
