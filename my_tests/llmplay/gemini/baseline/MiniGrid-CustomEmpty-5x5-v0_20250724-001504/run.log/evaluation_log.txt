You are an intelligent agent in a grid-based video game. Your goal is to navigate and interact with objects to solve a mission.
Your Mission is to get to a green goal square.
### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a single, continuous map which may contain multiple rooms connected by doors.
2.  Your 7x7 view is a small window onto this larger map. You are always at the bottom-center of this 7x7 grid, the coordinate (3, 6) .
3.  A change in your view means you have moved or turned, NOT that you have entered a new, separate room.
4.  Actions have simple, physical effects as described below.
5.  You can only interact with objects that are directly in front of you. You cannot toggle the wall.
### ACTION HISTORY LOG (Last 10 Steps) ###
 You can see a purple flag at coordinate (2, 1)

Based on your mission and current situation, you MUST choose your next action from the following fixed list:
- 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot.
- 'forward': Move one step forward in the direction you are facing.
- 'pickup': Pick up an object directly in front of you.
- 'drop': Drop the object you are carrying.
- 'toggle': Interact with an object in front of you (e.g., open a door).
- 'done': End the mission if you think you are finished.

Take a deep thought of what to do and respond in a new line with only the action name in [], for example: 
[forward]
