      "prompt": "\nYou are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (5, 8). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing North.

That yields the rectangle X=3..7, Y=4..8 as empty (including the start (5,8)).\n- I executed the moves and turns in the log, tracking absolute position and facing after each action. Each observation lists only walls in local (Depth, Side) coordinates. For each observation I:\n  - computed the nearest wall depth per Side s (if any),\n  - marked as visible-empty every local cell with d < d_wall (or all d=0..4 if no wall on that side),\n  - applied diagonal occlusion (a cell is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls).\n- I also marked every absolute cell the robot stood on (starting cell and every successful forward move) as empty.\n- I converted every visible local cell at each step into global (X,Y) using the robot's absolute position and facing (North: X= X0+s, Y=Y0-d; East: X=X0+d, Y=Y0+s; South: X=X0-s, Y=Y0+d; West: X=X0-d, Y=Y0-s).\n- Aggregating all visible-empty cells across all observations (and all traversed cells) produces the final set below.\n\nFinal map summary:\n&&&\nempty spaces at coordinates: (-1,3), (-1,10), (0,3), (0,10), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,10), (2,3), (2,10), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,10), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,10), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,10), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,10), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,10), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (9,10), (9,11), (9,12), (10,3), (11,3)\n&&&",

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (4, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing East.

Starting pose: (4,1) facing East (East = +X, South = +Y).\n- Local → global: global = pos + d*dir + s*right, where dir is the unit vector for facing direction and right is (-dir_y, dir_x). (This makes right = +Y when facing East, right = +X when facing North, etc.)\n- For each observation I found, for each side s ∈ {-2,-1,0,1,2} the nearest wall depth d_wall(s) (if any). Visible depths on that side are d ∈ [0, d_wall(s)-1] (or d ∈ [0..4] if no wall). Then I removed any cell (d,s) that is wall-listed, and removed any (d,s) for which both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls (diagonal occlusion). The remaining visible (d,s) were converted into absolute coordinates and added to the empty set. I also added every absolute cell the agent stood on or moved through.\n\nPose / motion trace (short)\n- Start: (4,1), facing East.\n- Step1: turn right → facing South (still at (4,1)).

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (4, 2). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing South.

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (8, 4). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing North.

      "prompt": "\nYou are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (4, 5). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing West.

I record every cell I stand on (path) and every cell that is visible-empty in each 5×5 local view (applying side-ray occlusion and diagonal-corner blocking rules).\n\nInitial observation (facing West, at (4,5)): no walls reported → whole 5×5 local view visible. That yields the 25 cells in front of me as empty:\nX = 4..0 (d=0..4), Y = 7..3 (s=-2..2).\n\nStep1: right → now facing North, still at (4,5). Walls at local:\n(0,2),(1,2),(2,2),(3,-2),(3,-1),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2).\nApplying per-side nearest-wall ray rules gives visible-empty local cells (d=0..2, s=-2..1). Mapped to globals and added to empty set.\n\nStep2: forward → moved to (4,4) (facing North). Observation walls: (0,2),(1,2),(2,-2..2). Visible empties (d=0..1, s=-2..1) added.\n\nStep3: forward → moved to (4,3). Walls: (0,2),(1,-2..2). Visible empties only at d=0 for s=-2..1; added.\n\nStep4: right → facing East at (4,3). Walls: (0,-1),(1,-1),(2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). Visible empties include many cells to the south/east; added.\n\nStep5: right → facing South at (4,3). Walls cluster at s=-2 depth 0 and s=-1..2 depth 4 → visible empties (s=-1..2, d=0..3) added.\n\nStep6: forward → moved to (4,4). Walls: (0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2),(3,-2),(3,-1),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2). Visible empties (s=-1..2, d=0..2) added.\n\nStep7: forward → moved to (4,5). Walls: (0,-2),(1,-2),(2,-2),(2,-1..2). Visible empties (s=-2..2, d=0..1) added.\n\nStep8: forward → moved to (4,6). Walls: (0,-2),(1,-2),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2). Visible empties only at d=0 for s=-2..2; added.\n\nStep9: left → facing East at (4,6). Walls: (0,1),(1,1),(2,-2..1). Visible empties (various d for s=-2..0 and all depths for s=2) added.\n\nStep10: right → facing South at (4,6). Walls: (0,-2),(1,-2),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2).

Visible empties for s≠-1 up to d<wall depths added (including many to the west and north).\n\nStep12: forward → moved to (3,6) (facing West). Walls: (0,-1),(1,-1),(2,-1),(3,-1),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2). Visible empties added (including cells west of me, many at X = 3..-1).\n\nStep13: forward → moved to (2,6). Walls: (0,-1),(1,-1),(2,-1),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). Visible empties added (westwards and northwards).\n\nStep14: forward → moved to (1,6). Walls: (0,-1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2). Visible empties added (mostly d=0 for s=0..2, and long west line for s=-2).\n\nStep15: right → facing North at (1,6). Walls: (0,-1),(1,-1),(2,-1),(3,-1),(4,-1),(4,0),(4,1),(4,2). Visible empties (long column to the west plus several in front) added.\n\nStep16: forward → moved to (1,5). Walls: (0,-1),(1,-1),(2,-1),(3,-1),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2).
