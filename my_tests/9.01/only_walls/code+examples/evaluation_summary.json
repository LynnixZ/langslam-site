Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (3, 3). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n### TOOLS: ###\nYou can generate Python code to reason about the world and build your map.\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing South.

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (3, 2). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n### TOOLS: ###\nYou can generate Python code to reason about the world and build your map.\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing East.

Forward moves were only applied when the previous observation did NOT include a wall at local (1,0). Turns updated orientation but did not change position.\n- For each observation after each action, I converted the reported local wall coordinates (Depth, Side) into global coordinates based on current absolute pos and facing. Then, per the ray rule, for each side s I marked as visible empty all local cells (d,s) strictly before the nearest reported wall on that side (or up to depth 4 if no wall), except cells blocked by diagonal corner occlusion ((d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) both walls).\n- I also included every absolute cell I stood on (traversed) as EMPTY.\n\nResulting empty absolute coordinates (sorted list):\n\n&&&\nempty spaces at coordinates: (-10, 2), (-10, 3), (-10, 4), (-9, 2), (-9, 3), (-9, 4), (-8, 2), (-8, 3), (-8, 4), (-7, 2), (-7, 3), (-7, 4), (-6, 2), (-6, 3), (-6, 4), (-5, 2), (-5, 3), (-5, 4), (-4, 2), (-4, 3), (-4, 4), (-3, 2), (-3, 3), (-3, 4), (-2, 2), (-2, 3), (-2, 4), (-1, 2), (-1, 3), (-1, 4), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 5)\n&&&\n\nNotes:\n- The list includes all traversed cells (I moved along x from (1,2) up to final (9,2)) plus cells seen as empty from the 5×5 local views after applying occlusion rules.\n- If you want the output in a different order or format (e.g., grouped by rows), I can reformat it.",

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (3, 3). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n### TOOLS: ###\nYou can generate Python code to reason about the world and build your map.\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing East.

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Take this as an example: You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).In this case, since the walls in (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) wrap around the grid (3, 0), (3, -1), (4, 0), (4, -1) in your view, those coordinates are considered unseen.\nSpecifically, apply the Ray rule per Side s:\n- For s = -1, nearest wall depth d_wall(-1) = 0  → all cells with (d ≥ 1, s = -1) are UNKNOWN (behind the nearest wall).\n- For s =  0, nearest wall depth d_wall(0)  = 2  → (1,0) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=0) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  1, nearest wall depth d_wall(1)  = 2  → (1,1) is VISIBLE EMPTY; (d ≥ 2, s=1) are UNKNOWN.\n- For s =  2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, 2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n- For s = -2, no wall reported               → (1..FOV_max, -2) are VISIBLE EMPTY unless diagonally blocked.\n\nDiagonal occlusion rule (corner blocking):\nA cell (d,s) is NOT visible if both (d-1,s-1) and (d-1,s+1) are walls. Otherwise it remains visible.\n\nIn particular, cells like (3,0), (4,0), (3,-1), (4,-1) lie at depths ≥ the nearest walls on their sides, so they are UNKNOWN (do not list them as empty).\nOnly the cells strictly in front of the nearest wall on each side, and not corner-blocked, are EMPTY at this step.The rest of the coordinates in your view are considered empty.\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view are not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (3, 8). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n### TOOLS: ###\nYou can generate Python code to reason about the world and build your map.\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing East.
