      "prompt": "\nYou are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - \n    - To make this task simpler, unknown cells **inside your local view** that are blocked by walls are listed in the log as `You cannot see coordinates (d,s), ...`.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (5, 10). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing West.

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - \n    - To make this task simpler, unknown cells **inside your local view** that are blocked by walls are listed in the log as `You cannot see coordinates (d,s), ...`.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (11, 9). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing North.

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - \n    - To make this task simpler, unknown cells **inside your local view** that are blocked by walls are listed in the log as `You cannot see coordinates (d,s), ...`.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (1, 9). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing West. You cannot see coordinates (0, -2), (1, -2), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, -2), (3, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, -2), (4, -1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)..\nStep1: right.

You cannot see coordinates (0, -2), (1, -2), (2, -2), (3, -2), (4, -2), (4, -1), (4, 0). You can see grey walls at coordinates (0, -1), (1, -1), (2, -1), (3, -1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)..\nStep3: forward.

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - \n    - To make this task simpler, unknown cells **inside your local view** that are blocked by walls are listed in the log as `You cannot see coordinates (d,s), ...`.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (12, 2). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing East.

Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell. Note there's empty spaces you haven't stand on but it was in your view. Please identify them as well.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - \n    - To make this task simpler, unknown cells **inside your local view** that are blocked by walls are listed in the log as `You cannot see coordinates (d,s), ...`.\n    - Empty cells are not explicitly listed in the log.\n \n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (10, 11). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing South.
