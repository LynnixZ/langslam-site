      "prompt": "\nYou are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 5x5 local view.\n\n### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###\nYour view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:\n1.  **Depth (0-4)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.\n2.  **Side (-2-2)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 0 is your center line. Negative Numbers are to your left; positive numbers are to your right.\n3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 0) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 0).\n4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:\n    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 or -1 in one coordinate depending on your direction.\n    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).\n    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.\n    - 'right':  Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.\n\n### YOUR TASK ###\n\n    Your mission is to return the coordinates of **all EMPTY cells** in the global map.\n\n    ## What counts as EMPTY\n    A cell is EMPTY if **either**:\n    1) You **stood on it** or **moved through it** at any time (your traversed path), or\n    2) It was in your local 5×5 field of view at least once and you clearly saw **no wall** in that cell.\n\n    ## Visibility and Occlusion\n    - You **cannot see through walls**. Any cell *behind* a wall along a line-of-sight ray is **unknown**.\n    - Diagonal shadowing: a cell at (d, s) is **not visible** if both its orthogonal predecessors are walls (i.e., blocked by the two adjacent cells).\n    - Cells blocked by walls inside your view may be unknown and not listed in the log.\n    - Empty cells inside your local view may be listed as `Coordinates (d,s), ... are empty`.\n\n    ## Reporting rules\n    - **Do not** list walls.\n    - **Do not** list unknown cells (never assume unknown = wall).\n    - **Only** output EMPTY cells you can justify from the log.\n\n    \nAll coordinates in the final summary must be absolute map coordinates (X, Y) in the room frame, not local (Depth, Side).\nIf you are facing a wall and go forward, you will not be able to move forward, your position will not change.\nYour starting absolute position is (6, 6). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.\n\n\n\n\n### OBSERVATION LOG ###\nInitial Observation: You're facing East.
