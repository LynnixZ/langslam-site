You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To build a consistent 2D map, I need to track my absolute position and direction at each step, then convert the local flag coordinates to absolute coordinates using the current position and facing. The absolute coordinate system has:
- East increasing the X-coordinate (first dimension).
- South increasing the Y-coordinate (second dimension).

My starting position is (1, 1) facing East. I ignore walls and only record flag positions (blue or purple) from each observation. For each step, I:
1. Update my position and facing based on the action (forward, left, right, turnaround).
2. Convert local (Depth, Side) coordinates of flags to absolute (X, Y) coordinates using:
   - **Facing East**: 
     - X_abs = my_X + Depth
     - Y_abs = my_Y + (3 - Side)  (since Side > 3 is left/north, decreasing Y; Side < 3 is right/south, increasing Y)
   - **Facing South**:
     - X_abs = my_X + (Side - 3)  (since Side > 3 is left/east, increasing X; Side < 3 is right/west, decreasing X)
     - Y_abs = my_Y + Depth
   - **Facing West**:
     - X_abs = my_X - Depth
     - Y_abs = my_Y + (Side - 3)  (since Side > 3 is left/south, increasing Y; Side < 3 is right/north, decreasing Y)
   - **Facing North**:
     - X_abs = my_X + (3 - Side)  (since Side > 3 is left/west, decreasing X; Side < 3 is right/east, increasing X)
     - Y_abs = my_Y - Depth

I process the log step-by-step, converting flag positions to absolute coordinates. Duplicate sightings (same flag at same absolute position) are noted but only recorded once in the final map.

#### Initial Observation
- **Position**: (1, 1) facing East.
- **Flags**:
  - Blue at local (1, 4): 
    - X_abs = 1 + 1 = 2
    - Y_abs = 1 + (3 - 4) = 1 - 1 = 0 → absolute (2, 0)
  - Purple at local (2, 5):
    - X_abs = 1 + 2 = 3
    - Y_abs = 1 + (3 - 5) = 1 - 2 = -1 → absolute (3, -1)

#### Step 1: Forward
- **Action**: Move forward → facing East, so X increases by 1.
- **New Position**: (2, 1) facing East.
- **Flags**:
  - Blue at local (0, 4):
    - X_abs = 2 + 0 = 2
    - Y_abs = 1 + (3 - 4) = 1 - 1 = 0 → absolute (2, 0) (duplicate, already seen)
  - Purple at local (1, 5):
    - X_abs = 2 + 1 = 3
    - Y_abs = 1 + (3 - 5) = 1 - 2 = -1 → absolute (3, -1) (duplicate)

#### Step 2: Forward
- **Action**: Move forward → facing East, so X increases by 1.
- **New Position**: (3, 1) facing East.
- **Flags**:
  - Purple at local (0, 5):
    - X_abs = 3 + 0 = 3
    - Y_abs = 1 + (3 - 5) = 1 - 2 = -1 → absolute (3, -1) (duplicate)

#### Step 3: Right
- **Action**: Turn right → was facing East, now facing South. Position unchanged.
- **New Position**: (3, 1) facing South.
- **Flags**:
  - Purple at local (2, 3):
    - X_abs = 3 + (3 - 3) = 3 + 0 = 3
    - Y_abs = 1 + 2 = 3 → absolute (3, 3) (new)
  - Blue at local (1, 4):
    - X_abs = 3 + (4 - 3) = 3 + 1 = 4
    - Y_abs = 1 + 1 = 2 → absolute (4, 2) (new)

#### Step 4: Forward
- **Action**: Move forward → facing South, so Y increases by 1.
- **New Position**: (3, 2) facing South.
- **Flags**:
  - Purple at local (1, 3):
    - X_abs = 3 + (3 - 3) = 3 + 0 = 3
    - Y_abs = 2 + 1 = 3 → absolute (3, 3) (duplicate)
  - Blue at local (0, 4):
    - X_abs = 3 + (4 - 3) = 3 + 1 = 4
    - Y_abs = 2 + 0 = 2 → absolute (4, 2) (duplicate)

#### Step 5: Forward
- **Action**: Move forward → facing South, so Y increases by 1.
- **New Position**: (3, 3) facing South.
- **Flags**: None observed (only walls).

#### Step 6: Right
- **Action**: Turn right → was facing South, now facing West. Position unchanged.
- **New Position**: (3, 3) facing West.
- **Flags**:
  - Blue at local (1, 4):
    - X_abs = 3 - 1 = 2
    - Y_abs = 3 + (4 - 3) = 3 + 1 = 4 → absolute (2, 4) (new)

#### Step 7: Forward
- **Action**: Move forward → facing West, so X decreases by 1.
- **New Position**: (2, 3) facing West.
- **Flags**:
  - Blue at local (0, 4):
    - X_abs = 2 - 0 = 2
    - Y_abs = 3 + (4 - 3) = 3 + 1 = 4 → absolute (2, 4) (duplicate)

#### Step 8: Forward
- **Action**: Move forward → facing West, so X decreases by 1.
- **New Position**: (1, 3) facing West.
- **Flags**: None observed (only walls).

#### Step 9: Right
- **Action**: Turn right → was facing West, now facing North. Position unchanged.
- **New Position**: (1, 3) facing North.
- **Flags**:
  - Blue at local (1, 4):
    - X_abs = 1 + (3 - 4) = 1 - 1 = 0
    - Y_abs = 3 - 1 = 2 → absolute (0, 2) (new)
  - Purple at local (0, 5):
    - X_abs = 1 + (3 - 5) = 1 - 2 = -1
    - Y_abs = 3 - 0 = 3 → absolute (-1, 3) (new)

#### Step 10: Forward
- **Action**: Move forward → facing North, so Y decreases by 1.
- **New Position**: (1, 2) facing North.
- **Flags**:
  - Blue at local (0, 4):
    - X_abs = 1 + (3 - 4) = 1 - 1 = 0
    - Y_abs = 2 - 0 = 2 → absolute (0, 2) (duplicate)

#### Step 11: Forward
- **Action**: Move forward → facing North, so Y decreases by 1.
- **New Position**: (1, 1) facing North.
- **Flags**: None observed (only walls).

#### Summary of Unique Flag Positions
- Blue flags: (2, 0), (4, 2), (2, 4), (0, 2)
- Purple flags: (3, -1), (3, 3), (-1, 3)

These are all distinct positions, with no duplicates. The final map includes all these flags.

&&&
a blue flag at coordinate (2,0) a blue flag at coordinate (4,2) a blue flag at coordinate (2,4) a blue flag at coordinate (0,2) a purple flag at coordinate (3,-1) a purple flag at coordinate (3,3) a purple flag at coordinate (-1,3).

2025-07-11 10:18:18,095 - INFO - Prompt for episode #1:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

I am reconstructing the map based on the observation log, starting from absolute position (1,1) facing East. I will track my position and direction after each action, convert local (Depth, Side) flag coordinates to absolute (x,y) coordinates, and accumulate the flags into a consistent map. I ignore walls as per the task.

- **Coordinate Conversion Rules**:
  - When facing East:
    - Absolute x = agent_x + Depth
    - Absolute y = agent_y - (Side - 3)  (since Side > 3 is left/North, decreasing y; Side < 3 is right/South, increasing y)
  - When facing South:
    - Absolute x = agent_x + (Side - 3)  (since Side > 3 is left/East, increasing x; Side < 3 is right/West, decreasing x)
    - Absolute y = agent_y + Depth  (forward is South, increasing y)
  - When facing West:
    - Absolute x = agent_x - Depth  (forward is West, decreasing x)
    - Absolute y = agent_y + (Side - 3)  (since Side > 3 is left/South, increasing y; Side < 3 is right/North, decreasing y)
  - When facing North:
    - Absolute x = agent_x - (Side - 3)  (since Side > 3 is left/West, decreasing x; Side < 3 is right/East, increasing x)
    - Absolute y = agent_y - Depth  (forward is North, decreasing y)

- **Initial State (Step 0)**:
  - Agent position: (1,1)
  - Facing: East
  - Flags in local view: (2,5), (1,5)
  - Conversion to absolute:
    - (2,5): Depth=2, Side=5 → x = 1 + 2 = 3, y = 1 - (5-3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (3,-1)
    - (1,5): Depth=1, Side=5 → x = 1 + 1 = 2, y = 1 - (5-3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (2,-1)
  - Flags collected: (2,-1), (3,-1)

- **Step 1: forward**:
  - Agent position: Move forward while facing East → (1+1,1) = (2,1)
  - Facing: East
  - Flags in local view: (1,5), (0,5)
  - Conversion to absolute:
    - (1,5): Depth=1, Side=5 → x = 2 + 1 = 3, y = 1 - (5-3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (3,-1) (already known)
    - (0,5): Depth=0, Side=5 → x = 2 + 0 = 2, y = 1 - (5-3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (2,-1) (already known)
  - No new flags.

- **Step 2: forward**:
  - Agent position: Move forward while facing East → (2+1,1) = (3,1)
  - Facing: East
  - Flags in local view: (0,5)
  - Conversion to absolute:
    - (0,5): Depth=0, Side=5 → x = 3 + 0 = 3, y = 1 - (5-3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (3,-1) (already known)
  - No new flags.

- **Step 3: right**:
  - Agent position: Turn right, position unchanged → (3,1)
  - Facing: Was East, turn right to face South
  - Flags in local view: (2,3), (2,4)
  - Conversion to absolute (facing South):
    - (2,3): Depth=2, Side=3 → x = 3 + (3-3) = 3 + 0 = 3, y = 1 + 2 = 3 → (3,3)
    - (2,4): Depth=2, Side=4 → x = 3 + (4-3) = 3 + 1 = 4, y = 1 + 2 = 3 → (4,3)
  - New flags: (3,3), (4,3)
  - Flags collected: (2,-1), (3,-1), (3,3), (4,3)

- **Step 4: forward**:
  - Agent position: Move forward while facing South → (3,1+1) = (3,2)
  - Facing: South
  - Flags in local view: (1,3), (1,4)
  - Conversion to absolute (facing South):
    - (1,3): Depth=1, Side=3 → x = 3 + (3-3) = 3 + 0 = 3, y = 2 + 1 = 3 → (3,3) (already known)
    - (1,4): Depth=1, Side=4 → x = 3 + (4-3) = 3 + 1 = 4, y = 2 + 1 = 3 → (4,3) (already known)
  - No new flags.

- **Step 5: forward**:
  - Agent position: Move forward while facing South → (3,2+1) = (3,3)
  - Facing: South
  - Flags in local view: (0,5)
  - Conversion to absolute (facing South):
    - (0,5): Depth=0, Side=5 → x = 3 + (5-3) = 3 + 2 = 5, y = 3 + 0 = 3 → (5,3)
  - New flag: (5,3)
  - Flags collected: (2,-1), (3,-1), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)

- **Step 6: right**:
  - Agent position: Turn right, position unchanged → (3,3)
  - Facing: Was South, turn right to face West
  - Flags in local view: (1,3)
  - Conversion to absolute (facing West):
    - (1,3): Depth=1, Side=3 → x = 3 - 1 = 2, y = 3 + (3-3) = 3 + 0 = 3 → (2,3)
  - New flag: (2,3)
  - Flags collected: (2,-1), (2,3), (3,-1), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)

- **Step 7: forward**:
  - Agent position: Move forward while facing West → (3-1,3) = (2,3)
  - Facing: West
  - Flags in local view: None (no flags mentioned)
  - No new flags.

- **Step 8: forward**:
  - Agent position: Move forward while facing West → (2-1,3) = (1,3)
  - Facing: West
  - Flags in local view: None
  - No new flags.

- **Step 9: right**:
  - Agent position: Turn right, position unchanged → (1,3)
  - Facing: Was West, turn right to face North
  - Flags in local view: (0,4), (0,5)
  - Conversion to absolute (facing North):
    - (0,4): Depth=0, Side=4 → x = 1 - (4-3) = 1 - 1 = 0, y = 3 - 0 = 3 → (0,3)
    - (0,5): Depth=0, Side=5 → x = 1 - (5-3) = 1 - 2 = -1, y = 3 - 0 = 3 → (-1,3)
  - New flags: (0,3), (-1,3)
  - Flags collected: (-1,3), (0,3), (2,-1), (2,3), (3,-1), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)

- **Step 10: forward**:
  - Agent position: Move forward while facing North → (1,3-1) = (1,2)
  - Facing: North
  - Flags in local view: None
  - No new flags.

- **Step 11: forward**:
  - Agent position: Move forward while facing North → (1,2-1) = (1,1)
  - Facing: North
  - Flags in local view: None
  - No new flags.

**Final Map Summary**:
- Grey flags at: (-1,3), (0,3), (2,-1), (2,3), (3,-1), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)

The map is complete with all flags from the observations.

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

### Reasoning Step-by-Step

I start at absolute position (1,1) facing East. I need to convert the local (Depth, Side) coordinates from each observation to absolute (X, Y) coordinates, ignoring walls and focusing only on flags. The absolute coordinate system has:
- X (first dimension): East increases X.
- Y (second dimension): South increases Y.

My position and facing change with each action. For each step, I convert local coordinates to absolute based on current position and facing:
- **Facing East**:
  - X_abs = my_x + depth
  - Y_abs = my_y + (3 - side)  // side > 3 is left (North, decrease Y), side < 3 is right (South, increase Y)
- **Facing South**:
  - X_abs = my_x + (side - 3)  // side > 3 is left (East, increase X), side < 3 is right (West, decrease X)
  - Y_abs = my_y + depth
- **Facing West**:
  - X_abs = my_x - depth
  - Y_abs = my_y + (side - 3)  // side > 3 is left (South, increase Y), side < 3 is right (North, decrease Y)
- **Facing North**:
  - X_abs = my_x - (side - 3)  // side > 3 is left (West, decrease X), side < 3 is right (East, increase X)
  - Y_abs = my_y - depth

I process each step, extracting flag observations and converting to absolute coordinates. After processing all steps, I compile a unique list of flags.

#### Step-by-Step Processing:
- **Initial Observation** (Position: (1,1), Facing: East):
  - Grey flag at local (2,3):  
    X_abs = 1 + 2 = 3, Y_abs = 1 + (3 - 3) = 1 → (3,1)
  - Blue flag at local (0,5):  
    X_abs = 1 + 0 = 1, Y_abs = 1 + (3 - 5) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (1,-1)
  - Flags: grey at (3,1), blue at (1,-1)

- **Step1: forward** (Position: (2,1), Facing: East):
  - Grey flag at local (1,3):  
    X_abs = 2 + 1 = 3, Y_abs = 1 + (3 - 3) = 1 → (3,1) (same as initial)
  - No new flags.

- **Step2: forward** (Position: (3,1), Facing: East):
  - No flags observed.

- **Step3: right** (Position: (3,1), Facing: South):
  - Blue flag at local (2,5):  
    X_abs = 3 + (5 - 3) = 3 + 2 = 5, Y_abs = 1 + 2 = 3 → (5,3)
  - Flags: blue at (5,3)

- **Step4: forward** (Position: (3,2), Facing: South):
  - Blue flag at local (1,5):  
    X_abs = 3 + (5 - 3) = 5, Y_abs = 2 + 1 = 3 → (5,3) (same as Step3)

- **Step5: forward** (Position: (3,3), Facing: South):
  - Blue flag at local (0,5):  
    X_abs = 3 + (5 - 3) = 5, Y_abs = 3 + 0 = 3 → (5,3) (same as Step3)

- **Step6: right** (Position: (3,3), Facing: West):
  - Blue flag at local (2,3):  
    X_abs = 3 - 2 = 1, Y_abs = 3 + (3 - 3) = 3 → (1,3)
  - Grey flag at local (0,5):  
    X_abs = 3 - 0 = 3, Y_abs = 3 + (5 - 3) = 3 + 2 = 5 → (3,5)
  - Flags: blue at (1,3), grey at (3,5)

- **Step7: forward** (Position: (2,3), Facing: West):
  - Blue flag at local (1,3):  
    X_abs = 2 - 1 = 1, Y_abs = 3 + (3 - 3) = 3 → (1,3) (same as Step6)

- **Step8: forward** (Position: (1,3), Facing: West):
  - No flags observed.

- **Step9: right** (Position: (1,3), Facing: North):
  - Grey flag at local (2,5):  
    X_abs = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1, Y_abs = 3 - 2 = 1 → (-1,1)

- **Step10: forward** (Position: (1,2), Facing: North):
  - Grey flag at local (1,5):  
    X_abs = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1, Y_abs = 2 - 1 = 1 → (-1,1) (same as Step9)

- **Step11: forward** (Position: (1,1), Facing: North):
  - Grey flag at local (0,5):  
    X_abs = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1, Y_abs = 1 - 0 = 1 → (-1,1) (same as Step9)

#### Unique Flags from All Steps:
- Grey flag at (3,1)  // from Initial and Step1
- Blue flag at (1,-1)  // from Initial
- Blue flag at (5,3)   // from Step3, Step4, Step5
- Blue flag at (1,3)   // from Step6 and Step7
- Grey flag at (3,5)   // from Step6
- Grey flag at (-1,1)  // from Step9, Step10, Step11

The final map includes all unique flags at their absolute coordinates.

&&&
a grey flag at coordinate (-1,1) a blue flag at coordinate (1,-1) a blue flag at coordinate (1,3) a grey flag at coordinate (3,1) a grey flag at coordinate (3,5) a blue flag at coordinate (5,3)

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To build a consistent 2D map, I process each step of the observation log, tracking my absolute position and facing direction. I convert local (Depth, Side) coordinates to absolute (x, y) coordinates for each flag observation, using the following conversion rules based on my facing direction:

- **Facing East**:
  - Absolute x = my_x + Depth
  - Absolute y = my_y - (Side - 3)  (since Side > 3 is left, decreasing y; Side < 3 is right, increasing y)
- **Facing South**:
  - Absolute x = my_x + (Side - 3)  (Side > 3 is left, increasing x; Side < 3 is right, decreasing x)
  - Absolute y = my_y + Depth
- **Facing West**:
  - Absolute x = my_x - Depth
  - Absolute y = my_y + (Side - 3)  (Side > 3 is left, increasing y; Side < 3 is right, decreasing y)
- **Facing North**:
  - Absolute x = my_x - (Side - 3)  (Side > 3 is left, decreasing x; Side < 3 is right, increasing x)
  - Absolute y = my_y - Depth

I start at position (1, 1) facing East. Walls are neglected as per instructions. Flags are static, so I collect all unique flag positions from the observations, resolving any inconsistencies (e.g., flags not observed when on the agent's cell are still included if observed from elsewhere).

#### Initial Observation
- **Position**: (1, 1)
- **Facing**: East
- **Flags**:
  - Purple at local (2, 5):  
    Depth=2, Side=5  
    x = 1 + 2 = 3, y = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (3, -1)
  - Green at local (1, 5):  
    Depth=1, Side=5  
    x = 1 + 1 = 2, y = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (2, -1)

#### Step 1: forward
- **Action**: Move forward (facing East), so new position: (1 + 1, 1) = (2, 1)
- **Facing**: East
- **Flags**:
  - Purple at local (1, 5):  
    Depth=1, Side=5  
    x = 2 + 1 = 3, y = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (3, -1) (same as before)
  - Green at local (0, 5):  
    Depth=0, Side=5  
    x = 2 + 0 = 2, y = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (2, -1) (same as before)

#### Step 2: forward
- **Action**: Move forward (facing East), so new position: (2 + 1, 1) = (3, 1)
- **Facing**: East
- **Flags**:
  - Purple at local (0, 5):  
    Depth=0, Side=5  
    x = 3 + 0 = 3, y = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1 → (3, -1) (same as before)
  - No green flag observed (out of view).

#### Step 3: right
- **Action**: Turn right (from East to South), position unchanged: (3, 1)
- **Facing**: South
- **Flags**:
  - Purple at local (2, 3):  
    Depth=2, Side=3  
    x = 3 + (3 - 3) = 3, y = 1 + 2 = 3 → (3, 3)
  - Green at local (2, 4):  
    Depth=2, Side=4  
    x = 3 + (4 - 3) = 4, y = 1 + 2 = 3 → (4, 3)

#### Step 4: forward
- **Action**: Move forward (facing South), so new position: (3, 1 + 1) = (3, 2)
- **Facing**: South
- **Flags**:
  - Purple at local (1, 3):  
    Depth=1, Side=3  
    x = 3 + (3 - 3) = 3, y = 2 + 1 = 3 → (3, 3) (same as Step 3)
  - Green at local (1, 4):  
    Depth=1, Side=4  
    x = 3 + (4 - 3) = 4, y = 2 + 1 = 3 → (4, 3) (same as Step 3)

#### Step 5: forward
- **Action**: Move forward (facing South), so new position: (3, 2 + 1) = (3, 3)
- **Facing**: South
- **Flags**:
  - Green at local (0, 4):  
    Depth=0, Side=4  
    x = 3 + (4 - 3) = 4, y = 3 + 0 = 3 → (4, 3) (same as before)

#### Step 6: right
- **Action**: Turn right (from South to West), position unchanged: (3, 3)
- **Facing**: West
- **Flags**:
  - Green at local (1, 3):  
    Depth=1, Side=3  
    x = 3 - 1 = 2, y = 3 + (3 - 3) = 3 → (2, 3)

#### Step 7: forward
- **Action**: Move forward (facing West), so new position: (3 - 1, 3) = (2, 3)
- **Facing**: West
- **Flags**: None observed. The green flag at (2, 3) is not visible because it is now on the agent's cell (d=0, s=3), which is not reported in the view.

#### Step 8: forward
- **Action**: Move forward (facing West), so new position: (2 - 1, 3) = (1, 3)
- **Facing**: West
- **Flags**: None observed.

#### Step 9: right
- **Action**: Turn right (from West to North), position unchanged: (1, 3)
- **Facing**: North
- **Flags**:
  - Green at local (0, 4):  
    Depth=0, Side=4  
    x = 1 - (4 - 3) = 1 - 1 = 0, y = 3 - 0 = 3 → (0, 3)
  - Purple at local (0, 5):  
    Depth=0, Side=5  
    x = 1 - (5 - 3) = 1 - 2 = -1, y = 3 - 0 = 3 → (-1, 3)

#### Step 10: forward
- **Action**: Move forward (facing North), so new position: (1, 3 - 1) = (1, 2)
- **Facing**: North
- **Flags**: None observed.

#### Step 11: forward
- **Action**: Move forward (facing North), so new position: (1, 2 - 1) = (1, 1)
- **Facing**: North
- **Flags**: None observed.

#### Summary of Flag Positions
- From all steps, the unique flag positions are:
  - Green at (2, -1)
  - Purple at (3, -1)
  - Purple at (3, 3)
  - Green at (4, 3)
  - Green at (2, 3) (observed in Step 6, not on agent cell at that time)
  - Green at (0, 3)
  - Purple at (-1, 3)

The map includes all these positions, as flags are static and consistently observed from different viewpoints. The absence of a flag at (2, 3) in Step 7 is because the agent was on the cell, not because the flag is missing.

Final map: A green flag at (2, -1), a purple flag at (3, -1), a purple flag at (3, 3), a green flag at (4, 3), a green flag at (2, 3), a green flag at (0, 3), and a purple flag at (-1, 3).

&&&
a green flag at coordinate (2,-1) a purple flag at coordinate (3,-1) a purple flag at coordinate (3,3) a green flag at coordinate (4,3) a green flag at coordinate (2,3) a green flag at coordinate (0,3) a purple flag at coordinate (-1,3).

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

### Reasoning Step-by-Step

I start at absolute position (1, 1) facing East. The task is to build a consistent map of green flag positions by converting local (Depth, Side) coordinates from each observation to absolute (x, y) coordinates, based on my current position and facing direction. Walls are neglected as per the instructions.

- **Absolute coordinate system**: 
  - x increases to the East (first dimension).
  - y increases to the South (second dimension).
- **Local to absolute conversion**:
  - For a given facing direction, the relative position for a local (d, s) coordinate is computed using:
    - Forward vector (based on facing) for depth.
    - Left vector (perpendicular to facing) for side offset.
  - Absolute position: `(x_abs, y_abs) = (my_x + x_rel, my_y + y_rel)`
  - Side offset: `(s - 3)` units, where:
    - s > 3: left of facing direction.
    - s < 3: right of facing direction.
  - Conversion formulas for each facing:
    - **Facing East**: Forward = (1, 0), Left = (0, -1)  
      `x_rel = d`  
      `y_rel = -(s - 3)`  
    - **Facing South**: Forward = (0, 1), Left = (1, 0)  
      `x_rel = (s - 3)`  
      `y_rel = d`

I process each step from the log, updating my position and facing, then convert local flag coordinates to absolute:

- **Initial Observation**: Position (1, 1), facing East.  
  Green flags at local (1, 3) and (0, 5):  
  - (1, 3): `x_rel = 1`, `y_rel = -(3-3) = 0` → Absolute: (1 + 1, 1 + 0) = (2, 1)  
  - (0, 5): `x_rel = 0`, `y_rel = -(5-3) = -2` → Absolute: (1 + 0, 1 - 2) = (1, -1)  
  Flags: (2, 1), (1, -1)

- **Step 1**: Forward to (2, 1), facing East. No flags observed.

- **Step 2**: Forward to (3, 1), facing East. No flags observed.

- **Step 3**: Right turn to face South, position (3, 1).  
  Green flags at local (0, 4) and (2, 5):  
  - (0, 4): `x_rel = (4-3) = 1`, `y_rel = 0` → Absolute: (3 + 1, 1 + 0) = (4, 1)  
  - (2, 5): `x_rel = (5-3) = 2`, `y_rel = 2` → Absolute: (3 + 2, 1 + 2) = (5, 3)  
  Flags: (4, 1), (5, 3)

- **Step 4**: Forward to (3, 2), facing South.  
  Green flag at local (1, 5):  
  - (1, 5): `x_rel = (5-3) = 2`, `y_rel = 1` → Absolute: (3 + 2, 2 + 1) = (5, 3) (same as Step 3)  
  Flag: (5, 3)

- **Step 5**: Forward to (3, 3), facing South.  
  Green flag at local (0, 5):  
  - (0, 5): `x_rel = (5-3) = 2`, `y_rel = 0` → Absolute: (3 + 2, 3 + 0) = (5, 3) (same as Step 3)  
  Flag: (5, 3)

- **Step 6**: Right turn to face West, position (3, 3).  
  Green flags at local (2, 3) and (1, 5):  
  - (2, 3): `x_rel = -2`, `y_rel = (3-3) = 0` → Absolute: (3 - 2, 3 + 0) = (1, 3)  
  - (1, 5): `x_rel = -1`, `y_rel = (5-3) = 2` → Absolute: (3 - 1, 3 + 2) = (2, 5)  
  Flags: (1, 3), (2, 5)

- **Step 7**: Forward to (2, 3), facing West.  
  Green flags at local (1, 3) and (0, 5):  
  - (1, 3): `x_rel = -1`, `y_rel = (3-3) = 0` → Absolute: (2 - 1, 3 + 0) = (1, 3) (same as Step 6)  
  - (0, 5): `x_rel = 0`, `y_rel = (5-3) = 2` → Absolute: (2 + 0, 3 + 2) = (2, 5) (same as Step 6)  
  Flags: (1, 3), (2, 5)

- **Step 8**: Forward to (1, 3), facing West. No flags observed.

- **Step 9**: Right turn to face North, position (1, 3).  
  Green flag at local (2, 4):  
  - (2, 4): `x_rel = -(4-3) = -1`, `y_rel = -2` → Absolute: (1 - 1, 3 - 2) = (0, 1)  
  Flag: (0, 1)

- **Step 10**: Forward to (1, 2), facing North.  
  Green flag at local (1, 4):  
  - (1, 4): `x_rel = -(4-3) = -1`, `y_rel = -1` → Absolute: (1 - 1, 2 - 1) = (0, 1) (same as Step 9)  
  Flag: (0, 1)

- **Step 11**: Forward to (1, 1), facing North.  
  Green flag at local (0, 4):  
  - (0, 4): `x_rel = -(4-3) = -1`, `y_rel = 0` → Absolute: (1 - 1, 1 + 0) = (0, 1) (same as Step 9)  
  Flag: (0, 1)

**Consolidated Flag Positions**:
- From all steps, the unique absolute coordinates with green flags are: (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 5), (4, 1), (5, 3).
- These are consistent across multiple observations (e.g., (5, 3) seen in Steps 3, 4, 5; (0, 1) seen in Steps 9, 10, 11).
- No contradictions or new flags in steps without observations.

**Final Map**:  
The room contains green flags at the following absolute coordinates: (0,1), (1,-1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,5), (4,1), (5,3).

&&&
a green flag at coordinate (0,1) a green flag at coordinate (1,-1) a green flag at coordinate (1,3) a green flag at coordinate (2,1) a green flag at coordinate (2,5) a green flag at coordinate (4,1) a green flag at coordinate (5,3).

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.
