You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's go through the observations step by step and track the changes to build the map based on the information provided.

### Initial Setup
- **Starting Position**: (1, 1)
- **Initial Facing Direction**: East

### Steps:

1. **Initial Observation**
   - At position (1, 1), facing East. The first observation includes a blue flag at (2, 3) and a grey flag at (2, 5). The start point is also clear as there are walls around but no obstacles to the flags I need to note.
   - **Map Elements**: Blue flag at (2, 3) and grey flag at (2, 5).

2. **Step 1: forward**
   - Moving forward changes the absolute position to (1, 1 + 1 = 2). Now at (2, 1) facing East.
   - See a blue flag at (1, 3) and a grey flag at (1, 5). 
   - **Map Elements**: Blue flag at (1, 3) and grey flag at (1, 5).

3. **Step 2: forward**
   - Move forward again results in position (2, 1 + 1 = 3). Now at (3, 1) facing East. 
   - See a grey flag at (0, 5).
   - **Map Elements**: Grey flag at (0, 5).

4. **Step 3: right**
   - Turning right changes direction to South. 
   - **Position remains**: (3, 1).

5. **Step 4: forward**
   - Move forward results in position (3, 1 + 1 = 4). Now at (4, 1) facing South. 
   - Observes grey flags collected thus far.

6. **Step 5: forward**
   - Move one more step forward to (5, 1) facing South. 
   - No new observations or flags.

7. **Step 6: right**
   - Turning right changes direction to West. 
   - **Position remains**: (5, 1).

8. **Step 7: forward**
   - Move forward to (5, 0) facing West. 
   - No new observations or flags.

9. **Step 8: forward**
   - Moving forward results in (4, 0).
   - Still no modifications since there are walls only; no flags noted.

10. **Step 9: right**
    - Now facing North.
  
11. **Step 10: forward**
    - Move to (4, 1), no new flags seen.

12. **Step 11: forward**
    - Another forward step changes position to (3, 1), again with no new flags visible.

### Final Interpretation
Based on observations, I collected the following flags:
- Blue flag at (2, 3)
- Blue flag at (1, 3)
- Grey flag at (0, 5)
- Grey flag at (1, 5)

### Final Map Summary
Combining all observations and excluding walls, the flags visible within the environment lead to:

&&&
a blue flag at coordinate (1,3) a blue flag at coordinate (2,3) a grey flag at coordinate (0,5) a grey flag at coordinate (1,5)
&&&

Let's go through the observation log step-by-step to build the map:

1. **Starting Position**: You are at the absolute position (1, 1) and observing a full 7x7 grid (depth from 0 to 6 and side from 0 to 6) while facing East.

2. **Initial Observations**: You see multiple grey walls and some flags:
   - A blue flag at (2, 3).
   - A purple flag at (2, 5).

From (1, 1), we have:
- At (0, 0) to (6, 0): walls
- At (0, 1) to (6, 1): walls
- At (0, 2) to (6, 2): walls
- At (0, 3) to (6, 3): walls 
- And, downwards you see flags at previously mentioned coordinates.

3. **Step 1 (forward)**: Move to (1, 2), still facing East. Observations now include:
   - Blue flag at (1, 3).
   - Purple flag at (1, 5).

4. **Step 2 (forward)**: Move to (1, 3). Observations now include:
   - Purple flag at (0, 5).

5. **Step 3 (right)**: Turn to face South. Observations remain the same.

6. **Step 4 (forward)**: Move to (2, 3), observing:
   - a purple flag at (1, 3).

7. **Step 5 (forward)**: Move to (3, 3). Observations stay constant.

8. **Step 6 (right)**: Turn to face West. 

9. **Step 7 (forward)**: Move to (3, 2).

10. **Step 8 (forward)**: Move to (3, 1).

11. **Step 9 (right)**: Turn to face North.

12. **Step 10 (forward)**: Move to (2, 2). Observing:
   - Blue flag at (2, 5).
   - Purple flag at (0, 5).

13. **Step 11 (forward)**: Move to (1, 2). Observe flags remain the same.

Finally, summarize the flags seen:
- Blue flags at coordinates (2, 3), (1, 3), and (0, 5).
- Purple flags at coordinates (2, 5), (0, 5).

When we pool this all together and relate to positions accurately accounting for the robot's movements:

**Final Map Summary:**

&&&
a blue flag at coordinate (2, 3) a blue flag at coordinate (1, 3) a blue flag at coordinate (0, 5) a purple flag at coordinate (2, 5) a purple flag at coordinate (0, 5).

2025-07-11 11:11:56,188 - INFO - Prompt for episode #2:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

To reconstruct the 2D map based on the given observations, I will follow each step and track both my absolute position and the landmarks I encounter.

### Understanding Movements and Observations
1. **Initial Position**: Start at (1, 1), facing East.
2. **Observation Details**: Grey walls and flags are noted, but I will only focus on the flags for the map.

### Steps Breakdown
- **Step 0**: Initial Position is (1, 1), facing East. 
  - **Location**: (1,3): Green flag
  - **Location**: (1,5): Grey flag

- **Step 1**: Move forward (1,2), still facing East.
  - New Observation - Grey wall at (0,5) is noted.
  
- **Step 2**: Move forward (1,3) again.
  - Now see a grey flag at (1,4).
  
- **Step 3**: Turn right (facing South).
  
- **Step 4**: Move forward (2,3), facing South.
  - Flag at (1,4) observed again.
  
- **Step 5**: Move forward (3,3), still facing South.
  - Encounter (0,4) grey flag observed.

- **Step 6**: Turn right (facing West).
  
- **Step 7**: Move forward (3,2), facing West.
  - New green flag at (1,3) observed again.
  
- **Step 8**: Move forward (3,1), still facing West.

- **Step 9**: Turn right (facing North).
  
- **Step 10**: Move forward (2,1), facing North.
  - Again see (1,4) green flag observed.

- **Step 11**: Move forward (1,1), heading North.
  
### Compiling the Reconstructed Map
From my observations, I can compile the flags I noted:

- Grey flags at coordinates: 
  - (0, 5) 
  - (1, 4)
- Green flags at coordinates:
  - (1, 3)
  - (2, 4)
  - (0, 4)

### Final Map Summary
Now I will summarize the final observations in the specified format, ensuring coordinate references are correctly noted:

&&&
a green flag at coordinate (1,3) a grey flag at coordinate (1,5) a grey flag at coordinate (0,5) a grey flag at coordinate (1,4) a green flag at coordinate (0,4).

Let's analyze the observation log step by step to construct the map.

### Start Position
Starting Position: (1, 1)
Initial Facing Direction: East

### Map Overview
The map has dimensions starting from the position (0, 0) upward based on the movement, and coordinates will represent the identified or flagged points.

### Steps Breakdown

1. **Step 0** (Initial Observation): 
   - Grey walls are around, but there's a yellow flag at (2, 3) and a grey flag at (1, 3).

2. **Step 1** (forward): 
   - Move to (2, 1). 
   - Flag added at (1, 3). Now we have:
     - Yellow flag at (2, 3)
     - Grey flag at (1, 3)

3. **Step 2** (forward): 
   - Move to (3, 1). 
   - Wall continues; yellow flag at (3, 3).

4. **Step 3** (right): 
   - Rotated to South (facing down).
   - Wall continues at (3, 4).

5. **Step 4** (forward): 
   - Move to (3, 2). 
   - Wall continues, but additional flags at (0, 4).

6. **Step 5** (forward): 
   - Move to (3, 3). Wall continues.
  
7. **Step 6** (right): 
   - Rotate to West.
   - Wall at (1, 5) identified.
   - Yellow flag at (0, 5).

8. **Step 7** (forward): 
   - Move to (3, 4). 
   - Wall continues; grey flag at (0, 5).

9. **Step 8** (forward): 
   - Move to (3, 5). 
   - Wall identified.

10. **Step 9** (right): 
    - Rotate to North.
    - Wall at (2, 4) identified and yellow at (2, 5).

11. **Step 10** (forward): 
    - Move to (2, 5). 
    - Wall continues, flag at (1, 4).

12. **Step 11** (forward): 
    - Move to (1, 5). 
    - Wall continues, grey flag at (0, 4).

### Final Summary of Flags
- Grey flags at coordinates: (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5).
- Yellow flags at coordinates: (2, 3), (2, 5), (1, 5).

### Building the Output
Combining all flags into the output format requires collating these into the specified string format.

Final Output in the specified format:

&&&
a yellow flag at coordinate (2,3) a grey flag at coordinate (1,3) a grey flag at coordinate (0,4) a grey flag at coordinate (1,4) a yellow flag at coordinate (2,5) a grey flag at coordinate (1,5) a yellow flag at coordinate (0,5).

2025-07-11 11:12:28,581 - INFO - Prompt for episode #4:

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's analyze the observation log step-by-step to reconstruct the map based on the encountered flags (green and purple) while disregarding walls as instructed. We will keep track of our position, direction, and the flags seen along the way.

### Initial Setup:
- **Starting position**: (1, 1)
- **Your starting direction**: East
- **Absolute position**: (1, 1)

### Step by Step Analysis

#### Step 1:
- Move forward to (2, 1). (Facing East)
- **Flags seen**: Green flag at (1, 3), Purple flag at (0, 4).

#### Step 2:
- Move forward to (3, 1). (Facing East)
- **Flags seen**: No new flags mentioned.

#### Step 3:
- Turn right (now facing South), position remains (3, 1).
- **Flags seen**: Purple flag at (1, 5), Green flag at (0, 4).

#### Step 4:
- Move forward to (3, 2). (Facing South)
- **Flags seen**: Purple flag at (0, 5).

#### Step 5:
- Move forward to (3, 3). (Facing South)
- **Flags seen**: No new flags mentioned.

#### Step 6:
- Turn right (now facing West), position remains (3, 3).
- **Flags seen**: Purple flag at (2, 4), Green flag at (1, 5).

#### Step 7:
- Move forward to (3, 2). (Facing West)
- **Flags seen**: Purple flag at (1, 4), Green flag at (0, 5).

#### Step 8:
- Move forward to (3, 1). (Facing West)
- **Flags seen**: Purple flag at (0, 4).

#### Step 9:
- Turn right (now facing North), position remains (3, 1).
- **Flags seen**: Purple flag at (1, 3), Green flag at (2, 4).

#### Step 10:
- Move forward to (2, 1). (Facing North)
- **Flags seen**: Green flag at (1, 4).

#### Step 11:
- Move forward to (1, 1). (Facing North)
- **Flags seen**: Green flag at (0, 4).

### Final Map Summary
Throughout the observations, we noted the presence of flags at specific coordinates:

- Green flags: 
  - (1, 3)
  - (0, 4)
  - (1, 4)
  - (0, 5)
  - (2, 4)
  
- Purple flags:
  - (0, 4)
  - (1, 5)
  - (1, 4)
  - (2, 4)
  - (0, 5)

After filtering duplicates and ensuring consistent flag data, the complete flag data is summarized as follows:

&&&
a green flag at coordinate (1,3) a green flag at coordinate (0,4) a green flag at coordinate (1,4) a green flag at coordinate (0,5) a green flag at coordinate (2,4) a purple flag at coordinate (0,4) a purple flag at coordinate (1,5) a purple flag at coordinate (1,4) a purple flag at coordinate (2,4) a purple flag at coordinate (0,5).

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

To reconstruct the map, we analyze the provided log step by step, focusing on the observations made and the coordinates given.

### Initial Setup
- You start at absolute position (1, 1) and face East.
- The Depth coordinates range from 0 to 6 (closer to further), and Side coordinates range from 0 to 6 (with 3 being your center).

### Log Observation Analysis
1. **Step 1: Forward**
   - Move from (1, 1) to (2, 1).
   - You see a blue flag at (1, 5).
   
2. **Step 2: Forward**
   - Move from (2, 1) to (3, 1).
   - You see a blue flag at (0, 5).

3. **Step 3: Right**
   - Now facing South, no position change yet.
   - You see a blue flag at (2, 3) and a grey flag at (0, 4).

4. **Step 4: Forward**
   - Move from (3, 1) to (3, 2).
   - You see a blue flag at (1, 3).
   
5. **Step 5: Forward**
   - Move from (3, 2) to (3, 3).
   - No new flags noted, only walls.

6. **Step 6: Right**
   - Now facing West, no position change yet.
   - You see a grey flag at (1, 5).

7. **Step 7: Forward**
   - Move from (3, 3) to (3, 4).
   - You see a grey flag at (0, 5).

8. **Step 8: Forward**
   - Move from (3, 4) to (3, 5).
   - Only walls noted, no flags.

9. **Step 9: Right**
   - Now facing North.
   - You see a grey flag at (2, 4) and a blue flag at (0, 5).

10. **Step 10: Forward**
    - Move from (3, 5) to (2, 5).
    - You see a grey flag at (1, 4).

11. **Step 11: Forward**
    - Move from (2, 5) to (1, 5).
    - You still see a grey flag at (0, 4).

### Summary of Observations
Analyzing the flags you've noted, we can consolidate the map data as follows:
- **Grey Flags:** Imply specific locations.
  - (0, 5) - There's a repeated flag here.
  - (1, 4) - Observed in step 10.
  - (0, 4) - Observed in steps 9 and 11.
- **Blue Flags:** Indicate different notable locations.
  - (1, 5) - Observed in steps 1 and 6.
  - (0, 5) - Repeated, significant location.
  - (2, 3) - Noted earlier.

### Final Map Compilation
Based on the observations above, we compile the final map data noting the flags and their coordinates.

&&&
a grey flag at coordinate (0, 5) a grey flag at coordinate (1, 4) a grey flag at coordinate (0, 4) a blue flag at coordinate (1, 5) a blue flag at coordinate (0, 5) a blue flag at coordinate (2, 3).

4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's process the observation log step-by-step and build a consistent 2D map of the room.

**Initial Observations:**
- We start at absolute position (1, 1) and face East.
- The first local view (7x7) shows multiple walls, but importantly, a green flag at (2, 4) and a red flag at (1, 5).

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Step 1: Move Forward**
    - New Position: (2, 1)
    - Facing East.
    - Local view shows a green flag at (1, 4) and a red flag at (0, 5).
   
2. **Step 2: Move Forward**
    - New Position: (3, 1)
    - Facing East.
    - Local view shows a green flag at (0, 4).

3. **Step 3: Turn Right**
    - New Position: (3, 1)
    - Facing South.
    - Local view shows a green flag at (1, 3) and a red flag at (2, 4).

4. **Step 4: Move Forward**
    - New Position: (3, 2)
    - Facing South.
    - Local view shows a red flag at (1, 4).

5. **Step 5: Move Forward**
    - New Position: (3, 3)
    - Facing South.
    - Local view shows a red flag at (0, 4).

6. **Step 6: Turn Right**
    - New Position: (3, 3)
    - Facing West.
    - Local view shows a red flag at (1, 3) (previously seen) and a green flag at (0, 4).

7. **Step 7: Move Forward**
    - New Position: (3, 4)
    - Facing West.
    - Local view doesn't indicate any flags.

8. **Step 8: Move Forward**
    - New Position: (3, 5)
    - Facing West.
    - Local view still shows no new flags.

9. **Step 9: Turn Right**
    - New Position: (3, 5)
    - Facing North.
    - Local view shows a red flag at (0, 4) and a green flag at (1, 5).

10. **Step 10: Move Forward**
     - New Position: (3, 4)
     - Facing North.
     - Local view shows a green flag at (0, 5).

11. **Step 11: Move Forward**
     - New Position: (3, 3)
     - Facing North.
     - Local view again confirms existing flags without any new discovery.

### Map Construction
We are tasked to only focus on the flags and consequentially, the map derived from the flags would be:

- The observed flags are as follows:
  - (2, 4) is green
  - (1, 5) is red
  - (1, 4) is green
  - (0, 4) is red
  - (0, 5) is green
  - (1, 3) is red

We can summarize the flags into a consistent 2D map format:

&&&
a red flag at coordinate (1,5) a green flag at coordinate (0,5) a green flag at coordinate (2,4) a red flag at coordinate (0,4) a red flag at coordinate (1,3).
&&&

This summarizes the 2D map of the room based on the flags identified during the exploration.

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's analyze the observations step-by-step to build the 2D map of the room based on the descriptions provided.

#### Initial Position and Observations
- Starting absolute position: (1, 1) with orientation facing East.
- You see various grey walls (which we neglect in the final map) and two flags:
  - Green flag at (1, 4)
  - Blue flag at (0, 5)

#### Step 1: Move Forward
- New position: (2, 1)
- New flags seen: 
  - Green flag at (0, 4) (not previously noted, now noted)
  
#### Step 2: Move Forward
- New position: (3, 1)
  
#### Step 3: Turn Right and Move Forward
- Change orientation to South. 
- New position: (3, 2)
- New flags seen: 
  - Green flag at (1, 4) (previously noted)
  - Blue flag at (2, 5)
  
#### Step 4: Move Forward
- New position: (3, 3)
- New flags seen: 
  - Green flag at (0, 4) (previously noted)
  - Blue flag at (1, 5)

#### Step 5: Move Forward
- New position: (3, 4)
- New flags seen: 
  - Blue flag at (0, 5) (previously noted)
  
#### Step 6: Turn Right and Move Forward
- Change orientation to West.
- New position: (2, 4)
- New flags seen: 
  - Blue flag at (2, 3)
  - Green flag at (1, 4)

#### Step 7: Move Forward
- New position: (1, 4)
- New flags seen: 
  - Blue flag at (1, 3)
  - Green flag at (0, 4)

#### Step 8: Move Forward
- New position: (0, 4)
  
#### Step 9: Turn Right and Move Forward
- Change orientation to North.
- New position: (0, 3)
- New flags seen: 
  - Green flag at (1, 4)

#### Step 10: Move Forward
- New position: (-1, 3) - beyond '1' acceptable limits but not relevant since it doesn’t provide new visible flags.

#### Step 11: Move Forward
- New position: (-2, 3) - again beyond limits.

By evaluating these observations and movements, we can summarize the flags collected (eliminating duplicates):
- (0, 4): green
- (1, 4): green
- (1, 3): blue
- (2, 3): blue
- (2, 5): blue
- (0, 5): blue

### Final Map Summary
The flags and their coordinates are:
- Blue flags at (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 3), and (2, 5)
- Green flags at (0, 4) and (1, 4)

Final output:

&&&
blue flags at coordinates (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5); green flags at coordinates (0, 4), (1, 4).

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's go through the observations step by step, processing each movement and noting the observed flags and positions to generate the final map.

### Step-by-step Reconstruction:

1. **Initial Position**: (1, 1), facing East:
   - Flags observed: Purple at (1, 4), Grey at (0, 4). 

2. **Step 1**: Move forward to (1, 2), still facing East:
   - Flags observed: Purple at (0, 4). Continue noting previously observed flags.

3. **Step 2**: Move forward to (1, 3), still facing East:
   - Flags observed: Purple at (1, 4), Grey at (1, 5).

4. **Step 3**: Turn right to face South, now at (1, 3):
   - Flags observed: Purple at (1, 4), Grey at (1, 5).

5. **Step 4**: Move forward to (2, 3), still facing South:
   - Flags observed: Purple at (1, 4), Grey at (0, 5).

6. **Step 5**: Move forward to (3, 3), still facing South:
   - Flags observed: Purple at (1, 4).

7. **Step 6**: Turn right to face West, now at (3, 3):
   - Flags observed: Grey at (2, 4), Purple at (1, 4).

8. **Step 7**: Move forward to (3, 2), still facing West:
   - Flags observed: Grey at (1, 4).

9. **Step 8**: Move forward to (3, 1), still facing West:
   - Flags observed: Grey at (0, 4).

10. **Step 9**: Turn right to face North, now at (3, 1):
    - Flags observed: Grey at (1, 3), Purple at (1, 4).

11. **Step 10**: Move forward to (2, 1), still facing North:
    - Flags observed: Purple at (0, 4).

12. **Step 11**: Move forward to (1, 1), still facing North:
    - Flags observed: No new flags.

### Final Map Summary
After processing all movements and flags across the observations, we compile the notable flags:

- **Flags**:
  - Purple Flag at (1, 4) (noted multiple times)
  - Grey Flag at (0, 4) (noted multiple times)
  - Grey Flag at (1, 5)
  - Grey Flag at (0, 5)
  - Grey Flag at (2, 4)
  - Grey Flag at (1, 3)

There are no additional unique flags beyond these through the observations.

### Final Map Representation:
&&&
purple flag at coordinate (1,4) grey flag at coordinate (0,4) grey flag at coordinate (1,5) grey flag at coordinate (0,5) grey flag at coordinate (2,4) grey flag at coordinate (1,3).

3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).
    - 'left': Turn left by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning left you will now face North.
    - 'right': Turn right by 90 degrees on the spot. For example, if you are facing East, turning right you will now face South.
### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1, 1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers for first dimension, and South is the direction of increasing position numbers for second dimension.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).

2025-07-11 11:14:07,310 - INFO - LLM Response for episode #9:
To reconstruct the consistent 2D map of the room based on the observations, let's step through the log and analyze the actions taken and the observations made at each step.

### Initial setup:
- Starting position: (1, 1)
- Facing East initially.

### Observations and Actions Step-by-Step:

1. **Initial Observation:**
   - You can see walls all around your initial position.
   - Flags at coordinates: 
     - Grey flag at (1, 3)
     - Blue flag at (2, 4)

2. **Step 1: Move forward.**
   - New Position: (2, 1)
   - Flags observed: 
     - Blue flag at (1, 4)

3. **Step 2: Move forward.**
   - New Position: (3, 1)
   - Flags observed: 
     - Blue flag at (0, 4)

4. **Step 3: Turn right (now facing South).**
   - Observed flags: 
     - Grey flag at (0, 4)

5. **Step 4: Move forward.**
   - New Position: (3, 2)
   - No new flags observed.

6. **Step 5: Move forward.**
   - New Position: (3, 3)
   - No new flags observed.

7. **Step 6: Turn right (now facing West).**
   - Observed flags: 
     - Blue flag at (0, 4)
     - Grey flag at (1, 5)

8. **Step 7: Move forward.**
   - New Position: (3, 4)
   - Observed flags: 
     - Grey flag at (0, 5)

9. **Step 8: Move forward.**
   - New Position: (3, 5)
   - No new flags observed.

10. **Step 9: Turn right (now facing North).**
    - Observed flags: 
      - Grey flag at (2, 4)
      - Blue flag at (1, 5)

11. **Step 10: Move forward.**
    - New Position: (3, 4)
    - Observed flags: 
      - Grey flag at (1, 4)
      - Blue flag at (0, 5)

12. **Step 11: Move forward.**
    - New Position: (3, 3)
    - Observed flags: 
      - Grey flag at (0, 4)

### Summary of Findings:

- The log indicates the presence of flags at the following coordinates:
  - (1, 3) - Grey
  - (2, 4) - Blue
  - (1, 4) - Grey
  - (0, 4) - Grey
  - (0, 5) - Grey
  - (1, 5) - Grey

We see two types of flags: grey and blue; based on the observation at the end, I can conclude that the areas around these coordinates see the gathering of flags.

### Final Map Summary:

Incorporating the observations into the final map:
- The flags observed shall be denoted specifically as noted above.

Thus the final summary of the 2D map is:

&&&
a grey flag at coordinate (1,3) a blue flag at coordinate (2,4) a grey flag at coordinate (1,4) a grey flag at coordinate (0,4) a grey flag at coordinate (0,5) a grey flag at coordinate (1,5).
