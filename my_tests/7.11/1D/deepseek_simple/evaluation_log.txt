You are an expert spatial reasoning AI. Your task is to build a consistent 1D map of a corridor based on a sequence of limited, first-person observations.

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a static, continuous 1D track. Your absolute position on this track is a single integer.
2.  Your observation consists ONLY of the 6 grid cells directly in front of you.
3.  The number you see (e.g., "at coordinate 3") is a **relative position**, indexed 1 to 6.
    - Position 1 is the cell immediately in front of you.
    - Position 6 is the farthest cell you can see.
    - An object at relative position 7 or greater is invisible to you.
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is 1. East is the direction of increasing position numbers.

### OBSERVATION LOG ###
Initial Observation: You're facing East.You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 6, a purple flag at coordinate 2.
Step1: forward. You're facing East.You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 5, a purple flag at coordinate 1.
Step2: forward. You're facing East.You can see a green flag at coordinate 6, a yellow flag at coordinate 4.
Step3: forward. You're facing East.You can see a green flag at coordinate 5, a yellow flag at coordinate 3.
Step4: forward. You're facing East.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 6, a green flag at coordinate 4, a yellow flag at coordinate 2.
Step5: forward. You're facing East.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 5, a green flag at coordinate 3, a yellow flag at coordinate 1.
Step6: forward. You're facing East.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 4, a green flag at coordinate 2.
Step7: forward. You're facing East.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 3, a green flag at coordinate 1.
Step8: forward. You're facing East.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 2.
Step9: forward. You're facing East.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 1.
Step10: turnaround. You're facing West.You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 3, a green flag at coordinate 1.
Step11: forward. You're facing West.You can see a purple flag at coordinate 6, a yellow flag at coordinate 2.
Step12: forward. You're facing West.You can see a purple flag at coordinate 5, a yellow flag at coordinate 1.
Step13: forward. You're facing West.You can see a purple flag at coordinate 4.
Step14: forward. You're facing West.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 6, a purple flag at coordinate 3.
Step15: forward. You're facing West.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 5, a purple flag at coordinate 2.
Step16: forward. You're facing West.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 4, a purple flag at coordinate 1.
Step17: forward. You're facing West.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 3.
Step18: forward. You're facing West.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 2.
Step19: forward. You're facing West.You can see a grey wall at coordinate 1

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate 3, a green flag at coordinate 8, a blue wall at coordinate 5, a blue wall at coordinate 0
&&&
