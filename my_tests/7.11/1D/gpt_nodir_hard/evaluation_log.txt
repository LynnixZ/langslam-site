You are an expert spatial reasoning AI. Your task is to build a consistent 1D map of a corridor based on a sequence of limited, first-person observations.

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a static, continuous 1D track. Your absolute position on this track is a single integer.
2.  Your observation consists ONLY of the 6 grid cells directly in front of you.
3.  The number you see (e.g., "at coordinate 3") is a **relative position**, indexed 1 to 6.
    - Position 1 is the cell immediately in front of you.
    - Position 6 is the farthest cell you can see.
    - An object at relative position 7 or greater is invisible to you.
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.

Let's go through the observation log step-by-step and reconstruct the 1D map based on the observations.

### Initial Setup
- Start at Absolute Position: 1 (facing East).
- Observations are indexed from relative positions 1 to 6.

### Step-by-Step Processing

#### Initial Observation (Position 1)
- Position 1: Green flag at coordinate 6 (Absolute: 6)
- Position 3: Red flag at coordinate 3 (Absolute: 3)

#### Step 1 (Position 2)
- Move forward to Absolute Position: 2.
- Position 1: Green flag at coordinate 5 (Absolute: 5)
- Position 2: Red flag at coordinate 2 (Absolute: 2)

#### Step 2 (Position 3)
- Move forward to Absolute Position: 3.
- Position 1: Yellow flag at coordinate 6 (Absolute: 6)
- Position 2: Green flag at coordinate 4 (Absolute: 4)
- Position 3: Red flag at coordinate 1 (Absolute: 1)

#### Step 3 (Position 4)
- Move forward to Absolute Position: 4.
- Position 1: Yellow flag at coordinate 5 (Absolute: 5)
- Position 2: Green flag at coordinate 3 (Absolute: 3)

#### Step 4 (Position 5)
- Move forward to Absolute Position: 5.
- Position 1: Grey wall at coordinate 6 (Absolute: 6)
- Position 2: Yellow flag at coordinate 4 (Absolute: 4)
- Position 3: Green flag at coordinate 2 (Absolute: 2)

#### Step 5 (Position 6)
- Move forward to Absolute Position: 6.
- Position 1: Grey wall at coordinate 5 (Absolute: 5)
- Position 2: Yellow flag at coordinate 3 (Absolute: 3)
- Position 3: Green flag at coordinate 1 (Absolute: 1)

#### Step 6 (Position 7)
- Move forward to Absolute Position: 7.
- Position 1: Grey wall at coordinate 4 (Absolute: 4)
- Position 2: Yellow flag at coordinate 2 (Absolute: 2)

#### Step 7 (Position 8)
- Move forward to Absolute Position: 8.
- Position 1: Grey wall at coordinate 3 (Absolute: 3)
- Position 2: Yellow flag at coordinate 1 (Absolute: 1)

#### Step 8 (Turnaround) - facing West
- Move back to Absolute Position: 7.
- Position 4: Red flag at coordinate 4 (Absolute: 4)
- Position 1: Green flag at coordinate 1 (Absolute: 1)

#### Step 9 (Position 6)
- Move back to Absolute Position: 6.
- Position 3: Red flag at coordinate 3 (Absolute: 3)

#### Step 10 (Position 5)
- Move back to Absolute Position: 5.
- Position 2: Grey wall at coordinate 6 (Absolute: 6)
- Position 1: Red flag at coordinate 2 (Absolute: 2)

Following the same logic, I will fill in the map based on the observations. 

### Final Reconstruction
#### Assigning Objects to Coordinates
1. (Absolute Position 1): Green flag (from Step 9) and Grey wall.
2. (Absolute Position 2): Red flag (from Step 5) and Grey wall (from steps after).
3. (Absolute Position 3): Grey wall (from Step 4), Grey wall (as stated in steps later).
4. (Absolute Position 4): Green flag (from Step 2, Step 5) and Red flag (in consolidate) Grey wall.
5. (Absolute Position 5): Yellow flag (Stepped back from observations).
6. (Absolute Position 6): Grey wall (Step 6) and Yellow (step summary state).

From the repeated results, we can conclude a summarized 1D map string.

### Final Map Summary
&&&
a grey wall at coordinate 1, a red flag at coordinate 2, a grey wall at coordinate 3, a red flag at coordinate 4, a green flag at coordinate 5, a grey wall at coordinate 6, a green flag at coordinate 7

   - See grey flags at coordinates **6** and **3**.

3. **Step 2 (Position 3)**:
   - Moving forward increases my absolute position to **3**.
   - See grey flags at coordinates **5** and **2**.

4. **Step 3 (Position 4)**:
   - Moving forward increases my absolute position to **4**.
   - See grey flags at coordinates **4** and **1**.

5. **Step 4 (Position 5)**:
   - Moving forward increases my absolute position to **5**.

   - Confirming wall at **position 4**.

8. **Step 7 (Position 8)**:
   - Moving forward increases my absolute position to **8**.
   - See a grey wall at coordinate **3**.
   - Confirming wall at **position 3**.

9. **Step 8 (Position 9)**:
   - Turnaround; facing West now (position decreases).
   - Moving back to **7**.
   - See a red flag at coordinate **6**, a grey flag at coordinate **3**.

10. **Step 9 (Position 8)**:

13. **Step 12 (Position 5)**:
    - Turnaround again; facing East.
    - Moving back to **6**.
    - See a grey wall at coordinate **6**, a grey flag at coordinate **3**.

14. **Step 13 (Position 6)**:
    - Turnaround; facing West at **7**.
    - See a grey wall at coordinate **5**, a red flag at coordinate **3**.

15. **Step 14 (Position 7)**:
    - Moving back to **6**.
    - See a grey wall at coordinate **4**, a red flag at coordinate **2**.

16. **Step 15 (Position 8)**:
    - Moving back to **5**.

    - See a grey wall at coordinate **1**.

19. **Step 18 (Position 11)**:
    - Moving back to **2**.
    - See a grey wall at coordinate **1**.

### Final Reconstruction:
By compiling the observations into a consistent map, we summarize the findings as follows:

- At each coordinate, we identified the following:
   - Coordinate **1**: red flag
   - Coordinate **2**: grey wall
   - Coordinate **3**: grey wall
   - Coordinate **4**: grey wall
   - Coordinate **5**: grey wall
   - Coordinate **6**: grey wall
   - Coordinate **7**: grey flag
   - Coordinate **8**: red flag at different points in movement.

Combining all the findings, here's the final map summary:

&&&
a red flag at coordinate 1, a grey wall at coordinate 2, a grey wall at coordinate 3, a grey wall at coordinate 4, a grey wall at coordinate 5, a grey wall at coordinate 6, a grey flag at coordinate 7, a red flag at coordinate 5

Let's analyze the observations step-by-step, taking note of the absolute positions, observations, and what can be concluded from each log entry:

### Initial State
- Start position: **1** (facing East)
- Observed relative positions: 
  - Coordinate 1: yellow flag 
  - Coordinate 4: yellow flag
  - Coordinate 6: green flag

### Process Step-by-Step
1. **Position 1** (seen: yellow flag, yellow flag, green flag)
   - Absolute: 1 → Observations: yellow at 1, yellow at 4, green at 6
   - Map: `{1: yellow, 4: yellow, 6: green}`
  
2. **Step 1**: Move forward to **2**
   - Observations: relative to position 2: green at 5, yellow at 3
   - Map: `{1: yellow, 4: yellow, 6: green, 3: yellow, 5: green}`
  
3. **Step 2**: Move forward to **3**
   - Observations: green at 4, yellow at 2
   - Map: `{1: yellow, 2: yellow, 3: yellow, 4: green, 5: green, 6: green}`
  
4. **Step 3**: Move forward to **4**
   - Observations: green at 3, yellow at 1
   - No new information since 1 is already occupied, which implies: `{1: yellow, 2: yellow, 3: green, 4: green, 5: green, 6: green}`
  
5. **Step 4**: Move forward to **5**
   - Observations: grey wall at 6, green at 2
   - Creates a wall at 6: `{1: yellow, 2: green, 3: green, 4: green, 5: green, 6: grey}`
  
6. **Step 5**: Move forward to **6**
   - Observations: grey wall at 5, green at 1
   - Creates a wall at 5: `{1: green, 2: green, 3: green, 4: green, 5: grey, 6: grey}`
  
7. **Step 6**: Move forward to **7**
   - Observations: grey wall at 4
   - Creates a wall at 4: `{1: green, 2: green, 3: green, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey}`
  
8. **Step 7**: Move forward to **8**
   - Observations: grey wall at 3
   - Creates a wall at 3: `{1: green, 2: green, 3: grey, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey}`
  
9. **Step 8**: Turnaround → Now at **7**, facing West
   - Observations: yellow at 6, 3 and green at 1
   - Map remains the same since those are already noted: `{1: green, 2: green, 3: grey, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey}`

10. **Step 9**: Move forward to **6**
    - Observations: yellow at 5, 2
    - Map remains the same: `{1: green, 2: yellow, 3: grey, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey}`

11. **Step 10**: Move forward to **5**
    - Observations: grey wall at 6 and yellow at 4, 1
    - Confirming position: `{1: yellow, 2: yellow, 3: grey, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey}`
  
12. **Step 11**: Move forward to **4**
    - Observations: grey wall at 5 and yellow at 3
    - Updated: `{1: yellow, 2: yellow, 3: grey, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey}`

13. **Step 12**: Move forward to **3**
    - Observations: grey wall at 4, yellow at 2
    - Updated: `{1: yellow, 2: grey, 3: grey, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey}` 

14. **Step 13**: Turnaround → now at **4**, facing East
    - Observations back at 3 and 1
    - Reinforces past positions: `{1: yellow, 2: grey, 3: grey, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey}` 

15. Steps 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19 have similar outcomes confirming yellow walls and previous observations.

Final reconstruction of the map based on all observations consistently is:
```
1: green, 2: yellow, 3: grey, 4: grey, 5: grey, 6: grey
```

You are an expert spatial reasoning AI. Your task is to build a consistent 1D map of a corridor based on a sequence of limited, first-person observations.

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a static, continuous 1D track. Your absolute position on this track is a single integer.
2.  Your observation consists ONLY of the 6 grid cells directly in front of you.
3.  The number you see (e.g., "at coordinate 3") is a **relative position**, indexed 1 to 6.
    - Position 1 is the cell immediately in front of you.
    - Position 6 is the farthest cell you can see.
    - An object at relative position 7 or greater is invisible to you.
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### Step 2
- **Action**: Move forward to position 3.
- **Observation**: You see a purple flag at coordinate 6 and a green flag at coordinate 1.
- **Map update**: Position 6 has a purple flag. Position 1 is noted as grey.

### Step 3
- **Action**: Move forward to position 4.
- **Observation**: You see a purple flag at coordinate 5.
- **Map update**: Position 5 has a purple flag.

### Step 4
- **Action**: Move forward to position 5.
- **Observation**: You see a grey wall at coordinate 6 and a purple flag at coordinate 4.
- **Map update**: Position 4 has a purple flag; position 6 remains a grey wall.

### Step 5
- **Action**: Move forward to position 6.
- **Observation**: You see a grey wall at coordinate 5 and a purple flag at coordinate 3.
- **Map update**: Position 5 is confirmed as a grey wall; position 3 has a purple flag.

### Step 6
- **Action**: Move forward to position 7 (off the visible range, you see grey walls).
- **Observation**: You see a grey wall at coordinate 4 and a purple flag at coordinate 2.
- **Map update**: Position 2 has a purple flag.

### Step 7
- **Action**: Turn around (now facing West).
- **Observation**: You see a grey flag at coordinate 5 and a green flag at coordinate 3.
- **Map update**: Coordinate 5 is grey; coordinate 3 has a green flag.

### Step 8
- **Action**: Move forward to position 6.

- **Map update**: Position 3 confirmed grey; Position 1 confirmed purple.

### Step 12 to Step 24 (Continuous forward movement)
As you continue to see grey walls and gather more information, we can summarize the information observed as follows:

- **Coordinate 1**: Grey flag
- **Coordinate 2**: Green flag
- **Coordinate 3**: Purple flag
- **Coordinate 4**: Purple flag
- **Coordinate 5**: Grey wall
- **Coordinate 6**: Purple wall

### Final Map
So the final summary of the position flags in the corridor is as follows:
- A green flag at coordinate 2.
- A purple flag at coordinate 3.
- A grey wall at coordinate 4 (and coordinate 6).

Thus, the summary encapsulated in the required format is:

&&&
a green flag at coordinate 2, a purple flag at coordinate 3, a grey wall at coordinate 4, a grey wall at coordinate 6

Let's analyze the observations step-by-step to build a map of the corridor. We'll establish the positions of all the elements based on the clues provided in the observation log.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Position**: Starting at absolute position 1, facing East.
   - **Initial Observation (absolutely at 1)**: sees green flags at relative positions 4 and 2.
     - At absolute position 1: green flags at absolute positions 2 (1 + 1) and 4 (1 + 3).

2. **Step 1 (absolute position now at 2)**: Moving forward.
   - **Observation**: sees green flags at coordinates 3 and 1.
     - At absolute position 2: green flags at absolute positions 1 (2 - 1) and 3 (2 + 1).

3. **Step 2 (absolute position now at 3)**: Moving forward.
   - **Observation**: sees green flags at coordinates 6 and 2.
     - At absolute position 3: green flags at absolute positions 2 (3 - 1) and 6 (3 + 3).

4. **Step 3 (absolute position now at 4)**: Moving forward.
   - **Observation**: sees a grey wall at coordinate 6 and a green flag at coordinate 4.
     - At absolute position 4: wall at absolute position 6 (3 + 3) and green flag at 4 (4).

5. **Step 4 (absolute position now at 5)**: Moving forward.
   - **Observation**: wall at 5 and a green flag at 3.
     - At absolute position 5: wall at 5 (5) and green flag at 3 (5 - 2), confirming wall 6 and green at 3 remain.

6. **Step 5 (absolute position now at 6)**: Moving forward.
   - **Observation**: wall at 4, green flag at 2.
     - At absolute position 6: wall at 4 (4) and green flag at 2 (6 - 4).

7. **Step 6 (absolute position now at 7)**: Moving forward.
   - **Observation**: wall at 3 and green flag at 2.
     - At absolute position 7: wall at 3 (7 - 4) and confirmed green flag at 2.

8. **Step 7 (turnaround; back at 6)**: Now moving West to absolute 6.
   - **Observation**: sees green flags at 4 and 2.
     - Confirms green flags at 4 (6-2) and 2 (6-4) again.

Continuing in this fashion, we derive the remaining positions and observations confirming the cells up to absolute coordinate 7. When the observations repeat during the turnaround movement, we map grey walls and green flags with the absolute refocusing.

All observations from steps 8 through 27 essentially confirm that beyond position 2, only walls are visible due to direct sight lines being blocked.

### Final Coordinate Summary:
- From absolute positions 1 to 7, we see:
  - At position 1: green flag at 2.
  - At position 2: walls at 1, green flags at 3.
  - At position 3: wall at absolute 6 and green flag at 2.
  - At position 4: wall at 5 and green flag at 3.
  - At position 5: wall at 4 and green flag at 2.
  - At position 6: wall at 5 and green flag at 4.
  - At position 7: walls commence, no flags visible.

### Final Map Summary:

After building the corridor map step-by-step and confirming the relative positions of walls and flags based on the observations, the summarized output is:

&&&
a green flag at coordinate 2, a green flag at coordinate 3, a green flag at coordinate 4, a grey wall at coordinate 1, a grey wall at coordinate 2, a grey wall at coordinate 3, a grey wall at coordinate 4, a grey wall at coordinate 5, a grey wall at coordinate 6
&&&

This ensures we cover the locations and reasoning in the sequence of observations given.

You are an expert spatial reasoning AI. Your task is to build a consistent 1D map of a corridor based on a sequence of limited, first-person observations.

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a static, continuous 1D track. Your absolute position on this track is a single integer.
2.  Your observation consists ONLY of the 6 grid cells directly in front of you.
3.  The number you see (e.g., "at coordinate 3") is a **relative position**, indexed 1 to 6.
    - Position 1 is the cell immediately in front of you.
    - Position 6 is the farthest cell you can see.
    - An object at relative position 7 or greater is invisible to you.
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###

Let's analyze the log step-by-step while mapping out the corridor based on the observations:

1. **Initial Position (Coordinate 1)**: 
   - I see a purple flag at coordinate 6 (relative position 6), one purple flag at coordinate 1 (relative position 1), and a green flag at coordinate 4 (relative position 4).

2. **After moving forward (Now at Coordinate 2)**:
   - I see a purple flag at coordinate 5 (relative position 5) and a green flag at coordinate 3 (relative position 3).

3. **After moving forward (Now at Coordinate 3)**:
   - I see a purple flag at coordinate 4 (relative position 4) and a green flag at coordinate 2 (relative position 2).

4. **After moving forward (Now at Coordinate 4)**:
   - I see a grey wall at coordinate 6 (relative position 6) and a purple flag at coordinate 2 (relative position 2).

5. **After moving forward (Now at Coordinate 5)**:
   - I see a grey wall at coordinate 5 (relative position 5) and a purple flag at coordinate 1 (relative position 1).

6. **After moving forward (Now at Coordinate 6)**:
   - I see a grey wall at coordinate 4 (relative position 6).

7-8. **After moving forward (Position 7, 8)**:
   - I see grey walls in all visible positions at coordinates 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

9. **After turnaround (Now at Coordinate 8)**:
   - I see a green flag at coordinate 4 (relative position 4) and a purple flag at coordinate 2 (relative position 2).

10. **After moving forward (Now at Coordinate 7)**:
   - I see a purple flag at coordinate 6 (relative position 6), a purple flag at coordinate 1 (relative position 1) and a green flag at coordinate 3 (relative position 3).

11. **After moving forward (Now at Coordinate 6)**:
   - I see a purple flag at coordinate 5 (relative position 5) and a green flag at coordinate 2 (relative position 2).

12. **After moving forward (Now at Coordinate 5)**:
   - I see a grey wall at coordinate 6 (relative position 6), a purple flag at coordinate 4 (relative position 4), and a green flag at coordinate 1 (relative position 1).

13-19. **Continue moving forward until I reach to position 9**:
   - I keep seeing grey walls at most positions and continue to identify purple flags at lower coordinates.

20-35. **After observing from position 9 to position 15**:
   - Continually identifies grey walls and purple flags.

Ultimately, the map coordinates based on the continuous observations yield the following:

At coordinate 1: **purple flag**  
At coordinate 2: **purple flag**  
At coordinate 3: **purple flag**  
At coordinate 4: **grey wall**  
At coordinate 5: **grey wall**  
At coordinate 6: **grey wall**

Given all the information gathered, the final map summary is:

&&&
a purple flag at coordinate 1, a purple flag at coordinate 2, a purple flag at coordinate 3, a grey wall at coordinate 4, a grey wall at coordinate 5, a grey wall at coordinate 6

To reconstruct the 1D map from the given observations, let's analyze the log step-by-step, updating our understanding of what exists at each position.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Starting position: 1 (facing East):**
1. Observation at position 1: Green flag at 6, Blue flags at 4 and 1.
   
   -      ---1---2---3---4---5---6---
   -  1:  [B]      [G]         [G]   
   -  2:  [   ]                 
   -  3:  [   ]                  
   -  4:  [B]                      
   -  5:  [   ]                    
   -  6:  [G]                     

**Step 1: forward (position 2):**
- Now at position 2, observation: Green flag at 5, Blue flag at 3.
  
   -      ---1---2---3---4---5---6---
   -  1:  [B]      [G]         [G]   
   -  2:  [   ]                 
   -  3:  [B]                  
   -  4:  [   ]                 
   -  5:  [G]                  
   -  6:  [G]                  

**Step 2: forward (position 3):**
- Now at position 3, observation: Green flag at 4, Blue flag at 2.
  
   -      ---1---2---3---4---5---6---
   -  1:  [B]      [G]         [G]   
   -  2:  [   ]130                 
   -  3:  [B]                  
   -  4:  [G]                 
   -  5:  [   ]                   
   -  6:  [G]                  

**Step 3: forward (position 4):**
- Now at position 4, observation: Grey wall at 6, Green flag at 2.
  
   -      ---1---2---3---4---5---6---
   -  1:  [B]      [G]         [G]   
   -  2:  [G]                 
   -  3:  [B]                 
   -  4:  [G]                
   -  5:  [   ]                   
   -  6:  [W]                     

**Step 4: forward (position 5):**
- Now at position 5, observation: Grey wall at 5, Green flag at 1.
  
   -      ---1---2---3---4---5---6---
   -  1:  [B]      [G]         [W]   
   -  2:  [G]                 
   -  3:  [B]                 
   -  4:  [G]                
   -  5:  [G/W]                   
   -  6:  [W]                     
 
**Step 5: forward (position 6):**
- Now at position 6, observation: Grey wall at 4 (this confirms a wall at position 4).

**Continue until end of observations:**
After completing each observation and updating our understanding, we determine the status of each position:

- **Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 show a mix of flags and walls.**
- **Position 6 is always a wall after your last observations.**

### Final Map Summary:
From our deductions, we can summarize the final map representation of items at various coordinates:

&&&
a green flag at coordinate 1, blue flags at coordinates 2 and 3, a grey wall at coordinate 4, a grey wall at coordinate 5, a grey wall at coordinate 6

Let's process the observation log step-by-step and construct the map based on the provided observations. We start with an absolute position of 1 facing East.

### Step-by-step Positioning and Observations:

1. **Initial Position**: 1, facing East.
   - **Observation**: Blue flag at coordinate 6, grey flag at coordinate 5, red flag at coordinate 4.
   - Known Coordinates: 
     - Position 6: blue flag
     - Position 5: grey flag
     - Position 4: red flag

2. **Step 1**: Move forward to position 2.
   - **Observation**: Blue flag at coordinate 5, grey flag at coordinate 4, red flag at coordinate 3.
   - Known Coordinates:
     - Position 5: grey flag
     - Position 4: red flag
     - Position 3: red flag

3. **Step 2**: Move forward to position 3.
   - **Observation**: Blue flag at coordinate 4, grey flag at coordinate 3, red flag at coordinate 2.
   - Known Coordinates:
     - Position 4: blue flag
     - Position 3: grey flag
     - Position 2: red flag

4. **Step 3**: Move forward to position 4.
   - **Observation**: Blue flag at coordinate 3, grey flag at coordinate 2, red flag at coordinate 1.
   - Known Coordinates:
     - Position 3: blue flag
     - Position 2: grey flag
     - Position 1: red flag

5. **Step 4**: Move forward to position 5.
   - **Observation**: Grey wall at coordinate 6, blue flag at coordinate 2, grey flag at coordinate 1.
   - Known Coordinates:
     - Position 6: grey wall
     - Position 2: blue flag
     - Position 1: grey flag

6. **Step 5**: Move forward to position 6.
   - **Observation**: Grey wall at coordinate 5, blue flag at coordinate 1.
   - Known Coordinates:
     - Position 5: grey wall
     - Position 1: blue flag

7. **Step 6**: Move forward to position 7.
   - **Observation**: Grey wall at coordinate 4.
   - Known Coordinates:
     - Position 4: grey wall

8. **Step 7**: Move forward to position 8.
   - **Observation**: Grey wall at coordinate 3.
   - Known Coordinates:
     - Position 3: grey wall

9. **Step 8**: Move forward to position 9.
   - **Observation**: Grey wall at coordinate 2.
   - Known Coordinates:
     - Position 2: grey wall

10. **Step 9**: Turnaround to face West at position 9 (now 9).
    - **Observation**: Red flag at coordinate 4, grey flag at coordinate 3, blue flag at coordinate 2.
    - Known Coordinates have not changed, but we can deduce:
      - Position 4: red flag
      - Position 3: grey flag
      - Position 2: blue flag

Continuing through the log and using the same reasoning, we'll collect observations at each step. Combining this information results in the following complete identification of coordinates:

### Final Map Summary
- At position 6, there is a grey wall.
- At position 5, there is a grey wall.
- At position 4, there is a red flag.
- At position 3, there is a grey wall.
- At position 2, there is a blue flag.
- At position 1, there is a red flag.

Thus, the unified 1D map, with coordinates and items:

&&&

You are an expert spatial reasoning AI. Your task is to build a consistent 1D map of a corridor based on a sequence of limited, first-person observations.

### RULES OF THE WORLD ###
1.  The world is a static, continuous 1D track. Your absolute position on this track is a single integer.
2.  Your observation consists ONLY of the 6 grid cells directly in front of you.
3.  The number you see (e.g., "at coordinate 3") is a **relative position**, indexed 1 to 6.
    - Position 1 is the cell immediately in front of you.
    - Position 6 is the farthest cell you can see.
    - An object at relative position 7 or greater is invisible to you.
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is 1. East is the direction of increasing position numbers.

### OBSERVATION LOG ###
Initial Observation: You're facing East.You can see a purple flag at coordinate 3, a yellow flag at coordinate 2.
Step1: forward. You can see a purple flag at coordinate 2, a yellow flag at coordinate 1.
Step2: forward. You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 6, a purple flag at coordinate 1.
Step3: forward. You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 5.
Step4: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 6, a yellow flag at coordinate 4.
Step5: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 5, a yellow flag at coordinate 3.
Step6: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 4, a yellow flag at coordinate 2.
Step7: turnaround. You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 4, a purple flag at coordinate 3.
Step8: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 6, a yellow flag at coordinate 3, a purple flag at coordinate 2.
Step9: turnaround. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 5, a yellow flag at coordinate 3.
Step10: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 4, a yellow flag at coordinate 2.
Step11: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 3, a yellow flag at coordinate 1.
Step12: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 2.
Step13: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 1.
Step14: turnaround. You can see a purple flag at coordinate 6, a yellow flag at coordinate 1.
Step15: forward. You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 6, a purple flag at coordinate 5.
Step16: forward. You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 5, a purple flag at coordinate 4.
Step17: forward. You can see a yellow flag at coordinate 4, a purple flag at coordinate 3.
Step18: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 6, a yellow flag at coordinate 3, a purple flag at coordinate 2.
Step19: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 5, a yellow flag at coordinate 2, a purple flag at coordinate 1.
Step20: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 4, a yellow flag at coordinate 1.
Step21: forward. You can see a grey wall at coordinate 3

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate 3, a green flag at coordinate 8, a blue wall at coordinate 5, a blue wall at coordinate 0
