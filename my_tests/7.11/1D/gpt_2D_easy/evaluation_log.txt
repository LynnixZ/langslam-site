You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1,1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's break down each step of the observation log to construct the map based on the coordinates and items I encountered.

Initially, I am at position (1,1) facing East, which means the depth and side will be seen as follows:
- My position (0, 3) represents my center view.
- Each observation will provide insights into what's in the surroundings from my perspective.

### Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Position**: (1,1), facing East.
   - Current view includes:
     - Grey walls are not included in the map.
     - Green flags at (4, 3) and (2, 3).
     - Purple flags at (2, 3) (I might not annotate them if they are walls or behind them).

2. **Step 1**: Move to (1, 2), still facing East.
   - New items noted: Green flags at (3, 3) and a purple flag at (1, 3).

3. **Step 2**: Move to (1, 3), still facing East.
   - Observed green flags at (2, 3) and (5, 3).

4. **Step 3**: Move to (1, 4), still facing East.
   - Noting green flag at (4, 3) (already counted) and (1, 3) (purple flag).

5. **Step 4**: Move to (1, 5), still facing East.
   - New notes, green flags at (3, 3).

6. **Steps 5-12**: Continue moving to (1, 6) through (1, 0) facing East, documenting green flags at coordinates (2, 3), (1, 3).

7. **Step 6**: (Turnaround) now facing West at (1,0). My view would now center around (0, 3) as I face West.

8. **Steps 13-29**: Forward to (0, 3). A collection of green flags:
   - Noting once more the positions, I observe the same flags at several coordinates.

### Analyzing Collection
After processing each observation, I filtered the non-relevant observations focusing only on distinct flags and removed the walls.

### Final Summary 
- Green flags noted throughout are at coordinates (4, 3), (2, 3), (5, 3), alongside the purple flags at (2, 3) and more purple flags noted at (1, 3).
- Duplicates were omitted.

### Consolidated Map Output
The key items remain summarized based on unique coordinates for green and purple flags from observations:

&&&
a green flag at coordinate (4,3) a purple flag at coordinate (1,3) a green flag at coordinate (5,3) a purple flag at coordinate (3,3) a green flag at coordinate (2,3).
&&&

### YOUR RECONSTRUCTION ###
First, reason step-by-step about your position and what you see.
Finally, provide the final map summary in a new line, wrapped in "&&&" delimiters. For example:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (3,4) a green flag at coordinate (2,-2).

To construct a consistent map of the room based on the observations recorded in the log, it's important to analyze each step in conjunction with the corresponding observations made during that step.

### Analysis of Steps:

1. **Initial Position**: You're at (1,1) facing East, so your coordinates (header: Depth, Side) are:
   - (0,3): You're at (1,1)
   - (1,3): Seeing (walls focusing here)
   - Flags visible right in your direct line.

2. **Forward Steps**: This continues to pattern the room based on gained views.
   - Until Step 10: You move only forward without turning around, indicating a room pattern ahead.
   - **Walls** don’t go beyond (0,2) – (6,2) and (0,4) – (6,4). Flags appear consistently on Heat maps at (X not covered by walls noted).

3. **Turning around**: 
   - From this, as you turn around and start viewing from the back (East conversion to West), you fetch more flags.

4. **Position updates**: 
   - Upon stepping forward in various stages, flags are pinned.
   - A retrospective view captures flags uniquely at (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) consistently recur and can be traced.

### Final Map Construction
Thus, systematically arranging the flags and providing room structure based on directions:
- Flags at key coordinates are then reported. Repetitions only trace the positions effectively.

### Final Map Summary
Now, we compile the unique flags we noted, neglecting all wall regions. These flags feature prominently under reported states.

&&&
a blue flag at coordinate (6, 3) a blue flag at coordinate (5, 3) a blue flag at coordinate (4, 3) a blue flag at coordinate (3, 3) a blue flag at coordinate (2, 3) a blue flag at coordinate (1, 3) a red flag at coordinate (6, 3) a red flag at coordinate (3, 3) a red flag at coordinate (2, 3) a red flag at coordinate (1, 3).
&&&

This summons the flags identified accurately reflecting positions within the room space avoiding walls counted outright. The strategy followed provides systematic understanding translating movement into spatial representations, forming a coherent and systematic representation of the room accessed.

2025-07-11 03:55:31,049 - INFO - Prompt for episode #2:


You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1,1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

2025-07-11 03:55:41,353 - INFO - LLM Response for episode #2:
To reconstruct the grid world map based on the provided log, I will analyze the movements and the observed flags at each step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Position**: (1, 1) facing East (5, 3 as the starting depth and side)
   - Observed flags: purple at (6, 3), red at (5, 3), (2, 3), etc.
   - Walls do not count towards the map.

2. **Movements**:
   - Each "forward" command moves me one unit in the current facing direction (East initially).
   - Multiple observations will show me flags in the surrounding area and their respective coordinates will help confirm their additions to the map.

3. **Observations**:
   - Flags located at various coordinates will be noted when I am able to see them, confirmed by their coordinates. 
   - Red flags appear mostly in the column (`depth` associated with `side` 3).

4. **Handling Wall Observations**:
   - The walls observed do not influence the map but indicate areas that cannot be accessed.
  
5. **Final Processing of All Observations**:
   After processing all movements and flags:
   - Purple flags appear at (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), and (1, 3).
   - Red flags are consistently reported mainly in the same columns.

### Final Map Construction:
From the above analysis, it’s confirmed there are:
- Purple flags at (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), and (1, 3).
- Red flags at (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), and (1, 3).

This leads us to the following concrete observations for the map:

&&&
a purple flag at coordinate (6,3) a purple flag at coordinate (5,3) a purple flag at coordinate (4,3) a purple flag at coordinate (3,3) a purple flag at coordinate (2,3) a purple flag at coordinate (1,3) a red flag at coordinate (5,3) a red flag at coordinate (4,3) a red flag at coordinate (3,3) a red flag at coordinate (2,3) a red flag at coordinate (1,3).

To reconstruct the map based on the observation log, let’s analyze each observation step by step while keeping track of the movement and the items observed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Position and Direction**: 
   - Starting at (1,1) and facing East.
   - Observations include grey walls and flags at various coordinates.

2. **Movement and Observations**: 
   - Each forward step increments the position along the East-West axis (x-axis).
   - Not all observations contain new flags since some flags are seen multiple times.

The flags observed throughout the steps:
- **Step 0**: Initial flags - grey at (5,3), yellow at (4,3), purple at (2,3).
- **Step 1**: Seen flags - grey at (4,3), yellow at (3,3), purple at (1,3).
- **Step 2**: Seen flags - grey at (3,3), yellow at (2,3).
- **Step 3**: Seen flags - grey at (2,3), yellow at (1,3).
- **Step 4**: Seen flags - grey at (1,3).
- **Step 5**: Newly seen grey flag at (5,3) but already noted.

Repeating the observation of flags occurs several times as we continue to move forward and later turn around. 

### Final Position
After all movements and flags being taken into account, we averaged out the unique flags seen in their respective coordinates without considering the already noted grey walls. There are no conflicts with flag colors as each appears uniquely.

### Final Flag Coordinates
- Flags:
  - Yellow at (4,3)
  - Various grey flags noted seem to be redundant in this context (because they denote walls).

### Final Map Summary
After reviewing all observations and directions without overlooking the grey walls, the final map summary based solely on unique flag colors observed is:

&&&
a grey flag at coordinate (5,3) a yellow flag at coordinate (4,3) a purple flag at coordinate (2,3).

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1,1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's analyze the observation log step-by-step to build the map representation.

**Initial State:**
- Starting absolute position: (1, 1)
- Facing East: Increment in position numbers means moving to the right.

### Processing the Log Steps

1. **Initial Observation (position (1, 1))**: You see grey walls and flags around you but do not add the walls. You observe:
   - Red flag at (1, 3) - indicates a feature to consider in the map. 
   - Grey flags at (6, 3) and (4, 3) - add them in the context of distance.

2. **Step 1:** Move to (1, 2):
   - Position now (1, 2) -> Red flag at (1, 3) is confirmed to exist.
   - Grey flags at (5, 3) and (3, 3) - we add these in the appropriate positions.

3. **Step 2:** Move to (1, 3):
   - Position now (1, 3) -> Red flag at (1, 3) is still there, and now we confirm flags at (4, 3) and (2, 3).

4. **Step 3:** Move to (1, 4):
   - Position now (1, 4), we are still confirming the proximity of (3, 3) while red flags are maintained.

5. **Step 4:** Move to (1, 5):
   - Position now (1, 5) detects a flag at (2, 3).

6. **Step 5:** Move to (1, 6):
   - Position now (1, 6), confirms the red flag on our current line.

7. **Step 6:** Move to (1, 0):
   - Position now (1, 0) - environments and flags encountered remain similar.

8. **Step 7:** Turnaround to face West and calculate backward movement to see previous flags.

9. **Steps 8 to 17:** Continue marking positions until we wrap around, interpreting back from the origin (0, 3).

### Aggregating the Data
Now, I need to combine this all from movements in such a way to detail consistent coordinates on the map:
- Flags encountered along the West and East indicated density.

Based on the observations and flags that you have identified and reiterated upon seeing:
- Red flags at (1, 3), (2, 4), etc.
- Grey flags at sequential placements identified above (order matters).

### Final Map Summary

The consistent 2D map representing observed flags, rooms will be:
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (1,3) a grey flag at coordinates (2,3) a grey flag at coordinate (3,3) a grey flag at coordinates (4,3) a grey flag at coordinate (5,3).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial Position**: At (1, 1), facing East.
   - Flags observed: 
     - At (1, 3) (purple).
     - Walls from (0,2) to (6,2) and (0,4) to (6,4).

2. **Step 1**: Move to (2, 1).
   - Flags observed: 
     - At (6, 3) (purple).
     - Same walls as before.

3. **Step 2**: Move to (3, 1).
   - Flags observed: 
     - At (6, 3) (red).
     - At (5, 3) (purple).

4. **Step 3**: Move to (4, 1).
   - Flags observed: 
     - At (5, 3) (red).
     - At (4, 3) (purple).

5. **Step 4**: Move to (5, 1).
   - Flags observed: 
     - At (4, 3) (red).
     - At (3, 3) (purple).

6. **Step 5**: Move to (6, 1).
   - Flags observed: 
     - At (3, 3) (red).
     - At (2, 3) (purple).

7. **Step 6**: Move to (7, 1) where there's no space available. 
   - A purple flag was seen at (1, 3).

8. **Step 7**: Turn around and now facing West. 
   - Walls remain unchanged.

9. **Steps 8-34**: Continue moving West and observing while tracing back to the initial point observing flags as before:
   - The purple flag at (1, 3) appeared several times confirming its position.
   - The red flags appeared sequentially at the next cells as observed.

### Map Reconstruction
- The final map can be summarized with the following flags observed throughout the log.
- The flags at various coordinates:
  - At (6, 3) (purple)
  - At (5, 3) (purple and red)
  - At (4, 3) (purple and red)
  - At (3, 3) (purple and red)
  - At (2, 3) (purple)
  - At (1, 3) (purple)

All observations have been collated through relative positions after reconstructive movements.

### Final Map Summary
&&&
a red flag at coordinate (6,3) a purple flag at coordinate (1,3) a red flag at coordinate (5,3) a purple flag at coordinate (5,3) a red flag at coordinate (4,3) a purple flag at coordinate (4,3) a red flag at coordinate (3,3) a purple flag at coordinate (3,3) a purple flag at coordinate (2,3)

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1,1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's go through the observation log step-by-step to construct our map:

1. **Initial Position and Facing East**: Starting at (1,1) facing East, the view shows walls in positions that do not affect the map.
   - Observed flags: blue at (4,3), red at (3,3).
   - This means flags exist at specified locations, which we'll record.

2. **Step 1: Move Forward**: Now at (2,1), still facing East.
   - New Observed Flags: blue at (3,3), red at (2,3).
   - We're recording more flags.

3. **Step 2: Move Forward**: Now at (3,1), facing East.
   - Observed flag: green at (6,3), blue at (2,3), red at (1,3).
   - Record the flags.

4. **Steps 3 to 7: Moving Forward Again**: Continue to move East until reaching (7,1). 
   - Flags observed include consistent blue and red flags along with green flags appearing at different depths.
   - Record all observed flags during these moves.

5. **Step 8: Turnaround**: Position is now still at (7,1) but facing West.
   - Observed flags reverted back while checking the previous positions.

6. **Steps 9 to 14**: Progress back West. The flags are observed again in those earlier positions.
   - Continue to record all flags through these movements back.

7. **Final Observations**: Eventually turning and moving forward again aids in confirming earlier flags.

By the conclusion:
- The flags' coordinates have been noted consistently during the movements.
- No barriers obstruct the flags' positions from 1 to 6 in the 7x7 grid.

Now, summarizing the findings, I will provide the final summary of the map:

&&&
a blue flag at coordinate (4,3) a red flag at coordinate (3,3) a blue flag at coordinate (3,3) a red flag at coordinate (2,3) a green flag at coordinate (6,3) a blue flag at coordinate (2,3) a red flag at coordinate (1,3) a green flag at coordinate (5,3) a blue flag at coordinate (1,3) a red flag at coordinate (3,3) a green flag at coordinate (2,3) a red flag at coordinate (1,3).

3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1,1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

2025-07-11 03:56:55,532 - INFO - LLM Response for episode #7:
Let's break down the observations step-by-step, keeping track of the positions and the flags I see:

1. **Initial Position**: (1, 1)
   - Facing East.
   - I see red flags at (2, 3) and (1, 3).

2. **Step 1**: Move Forward to (1, 2).
   - I see a green flag at (6, 3) and a red flag at (1, 3).

3. **Step 2**: Move Forward to (1, 3).
   - I see a green flag at (5, 3).

4. **Step 3**: Move Forward to (1, 4).
   - I see a green flag at (4, 3).

5. **Step 4**: Move Forward to (1, 5).
   - I see a green flag at (3, 3).

6. **Step 5**: Move Forward to (1, 6).
   - I see a green flag at (2, 3).
   
7. **Step 6**: Move Forward to (1, 7).
   - I see a green flag at (1, 3).
   
8. **Step 7**: Move Forward to (1, 8).
   
9. **Step 8**: Move Backward to (1, 7). 

10. **Step 9**: Move Backward to (1, 6).
    
11. **Step 10**: Move Backward to (1, 5).
    
12. **Step 11**: Move Backward to (1, 4).
    
13. **Step 12**: Move Backward to (1, 3).
    
14. **Step 13**: Move Backward to (1, 2).
    
15. **Step 14**: Move Backward to (1, 1).
    
16. **Step 15**: Turnaround.
    
17. **Step 16**: Move Forward to (1, 0).
    
18. **Step 17**: Move Forward to (1, -1).
    
19. **...** Steps continue until reaching back to initial position.

At each step, I check for unvisited flags and walls and build the map accordingly.

### Summary of Flags
Next, after analyzing, I deduce that:

- **Red Flags** are found at: 
  - (1, 3) - seen multiple times 
  - (2, 3)
  - (3, 3)
  - (4, 3)
  - (5, 3)

- **Green Flags** are consistently found along with Red flags at coordinates:
  - (2, 3)
  - (1, 3)
  - (3, 3)
  - (4, 3)
  - (5, 3)
  - (6, 3)

Based off the observations and positions I've collected throughout the log, the final map summary after reconstructing recognized flags is:

&&&
a red flag at coordinate (1,3), a green flag at coordinate (2,3), a green flag at coordinate (3,3), a green flag at coordinate (4,3), a green flag at coordinate (2,3), a red flag at coordinate (5,3), a red flag at coordinate (6,3).

You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1,1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

Let's break down the observations and build the map step-by-step based on the given log.

1. **Initial State:** 
   - Starting position is (1, 1), facing East.
   - Initial observation shows flags and walls but we need to disregard walls.
   - Flags observed: a **red flag** at (1, 3) and a **purple flag** at (6, 3).

2. **Movement and Observations:**
   - Moving forward in each step changes our absolute position by +1 in the East direction until we reach (1, 6).
   - Each time we reach a new observation state, we can note the flags captured in that observation.

3. **Coordinates and Flags Noticed:**
   - As we process each forward move:
     - **Step 1:** A purple flag at (5, 3), a yellow flag at (6, 3).
     - **Step 2:** A purple flag at (4, 3), a yellow flag remains at (5, 3).
     - **Step 3:** A purple flag at (3, 3), with previous flags remaining.
     - **Step 4:** A purple flag at (2, 3), with yellow flag at (3, 3).
     - As we keep going forward until Step 8, we eventually note:
       - A purple flag at (1, 3) and (1, 4) seen multiple times.
     - Finally, we get to Step 27, where we observe the same flags again, confirming the consistency of the observations.

4. **Backtracking and Observation Confirmation:**
   - In steps that signal the turnaround (steps 10 and 22), we confirm our observations again.
   - Moving back through previously traversed areas confirms the existing flags persist at their noted spots.

### Final Consolidation of the Map:
After analyzing all observations from both forward and turnaround movements, here are the flags we observed and their coordinates clearly noted on the map.

#### Final Map Summary:
1. Yellow flags: (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), 
2. Purple flags: (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3).
3. Red flag: (1, 3).

The flags are summarized below.

&&&
a red flag at coordinate (1,3) a yellow flag at coordinate (6,3) a yellow flag at coordinate (5,3) a yellow flag at coordinate (4,3) a yellow flag at coordinate (3,3) a purple flag at coordinate (2,3).

2025-07-11 03:57:13,922 - INFO - Prompt for episode #9:


You are a robot agent inside a grid world. Your task is to build a consistent 2D map of a room based on a 7x7 local view.

### YOUR COORDINATE SYSTEM ###
Your view is described using a special (Depth, Side) coordinate system:
1.  **Depth (0-6)**: Represents the front-back direction. Depth 0 is your location. Larger numbers are farther away from you.
2.  **Side (0-6)**: Represents the left-right direction. Side 3 is your center line. Numbers greater than 3 are to your left; numbers less than 3 are to your right.
3.  **Your Position**: You are ALWAYS at coordinate (0, 3) in this system. The space directly in front of you is (1, 3).
4.  Your movement is governed by your absolute position and direction:
    - 'forward': Changes your absolute position by +1 if facing East (positive direction), or -1 if facing West (negative direction).
    - 'turnaround': Reverses your direction (East becomes West, West becomes East).

### YOUR TASK ###
Your mission is to process the following log step-by-step and create a single, unified map of the world.
Your starting absolute position is (1,1). East is the direction of increasing position numbers.
Note that you will see walls in your view, but they are not part of the map you need to build. Neglect them.

To construct the 2D map, we'll track the robot's movements and observations step-by-step.

### Initial Setup
- **Starting Absolute Position:** (1, 1)
- **Direction:** Facing East

### Observations and Movement Breakdown

1. **Initial Observation**: Maps out the flags and walls. Flags seen: Yellow at (1, 3), Purple at (4, 3), Blue at (5, 3).
2. **Step 1**: move forward to (1, 2) → States current position as (2, 1) based on movement.
   - Flags seen (4, 3) purple, (3, 3) blue.
3. **Step 2**: move forward to (2, 2) → Now at (3, 1). Observed flags (3, 3) blue, (2, 3) purple.
4. **Step 3**: move forward to (3, 2) → Now at (4, 1). Flags (2, 3) blue, (1, 3) purple.
5. **Step 4**: move forward to (4, 2) → Now at (5, 1). Flags (1, 3) blue.
6. **Step 5**: move forward to (5, 2) → Now at (6, 1). 
   - Only Viewable Flags: (5, 3) blue, (5, 4) list of walls visible.
7. **Steps 6 to 10**: Advance further into the position for (6, 1).
8. **Step 7**: turnaround → Change direction to West.
9. **Steps 8 to 14**: Backtrack through seen flags noting back all occurrences of ambiguity and direction reversals.
10. **Steps 15 to 19**: Move forward while in West direction again and observed flags.
11. **Step 20**: turn around again to check remaining portions of the world to observe flags as seen at backward positions.
12. **Step 21 to 27**: Continue backtracking while retaining observations of walls.

### Final Map Reconstruction
Throughout this process, I've confirmed the presence of flags and observed they maintain their flags based on position notation in such a way as:

- Yellow flag locations indicate noted coordinates repeatedly through (1,3).
- Blue flags present at (5,3) on multiple observations, mapping correctly as per instructed movement forward and backward.
- Purple flags also stay situated based on finds from different angles.

With listed flags being consolidated, we reflect on;

- Yellow flag at (1, 3)
- Purple at (4, 3)
- Blue at (5, 3)
- Repeat notated wall coordinates leave room for further construction as needed, working around cleared checks, but each flag is essential for fixing grid mapping.

Thus, our definitive map summary is:
&&&
a yellow flag at coordinate (1,3) a purple flag at coordinate (4,3) a blue flag at coordinate (5,3).
